 design and operational question is whether to
fully enclose and secure the post or to leave it an
open, counter-like area, as discussed in 
 , “Surveillance/Supervision ”
The open-counter area is much more versatile
from a staff point of view, allowing the officer to
move freely from the post to perform duties and
services other than those demanded within the
post itselfSuch versatility potentially distributes
work better, improves supervision by allowing
better and more frequent inmate contact, facilitates
two-way communication between staff and
inmates, and minimizes the need for additional
staffWithout careful planning and design, however,
the open design can lead to security
compromises 
The following questions should be considered
when determining the design of a staff post:
 Can tasks be performed more efficiently from
a post that restricts staff movement or one that
enhances staff movement and flexibility?

Staff Backup in the Smaller Jail
In many smaller jails, a single master control officer
will be able to observe most inmate housing
areas from a remote, fixed postHowever, that staff
member’s ability to physically respond, unassisted, to
incidents such as assaults, medical emergencies, or
escape attempts may be severely limited by a need
to retain control of the secure post and by concerns
for his/her own personal safetyAlthough that officer
cannot respond directly to a problem, he/she is able
to provide direct visual backup assistance to officers
who do enter the housing units or other inmateoccupied
areas 
Unfortunately, it can be assumed that numerous
small jails may be staffed with two-person, male/
female teams on each shift, with one officer in a
secure master control station and the other in a roving
capacityGiven the need to maintain the security
of a master control room, the officer can ill afford
to leave it to render assistanceTherefore, his/
her chief tool in providing backup assistance is an
unobstructed view of all inmate-occupied areas and
communication linkages through which to interact
verbally with inmates and, most critically, to summon
outside assistanceHowever, if outside assistance,
such as from law enforcement personnel in adjacent
areas of the facility, is not immediately available,
this two-person approach becomes quite problematic
when serious problems ariseThe goal should be to
provide backup for any staff member in any area of
the jail, with the desired approach of providing sufficient
staff within the secure perimeter at all timesIf
this is not achievable, the alternative option of using
sworn law enforcement staff who are available at
any time from an adjacent, attached building may be
considered 
Through this team approach, which combines direct
interaction of the roving officer with the backup of a
master control officer and outside assistance, the welldesigned
small jail can respond to most occurrences
without creating excessive risk to staff or inmates 
 Is backup security available to reduce the risks
of an open-counter arrangement?
 What is at stake if the post is lost?
 What is the impact on inmate surveillance and
supervision if the post is opened or closed?
 What level of inmate contact and communication
is desired?
 Do staff have the ability to communicate with
other staff in the area?
 What are the potential staff savings?
The open-counter housing post is not viable unless
the jail maintains a secure master control
room with complete override capability on all
security systems and full control of the perimeter
of the housing area 
Cell Occupancy
Although there is no irrefutable evidence that
single-cell jails are less costly to staff than facilities
with multiple-occupancy cells, there are
strong arguments that single-cell housing results
in more efficient use of staffThese arguments
generally include the following:
 Multiple-occupancy housing greatly reduces
the staff’s ability to prevent physical or sexual
assaults, especially during night lockdown,
when staffing levels tend to be reduced 
Multiple-occupancy housing may eliminate
the ability to reduce staffing at night 
 During a disturbance in a multiple-occupancy
cell, the staff’s ability to take full control of the
incident is reduced due to the inability to fully
separate combative inmates 
 Multiple-occupancy cells diminish staff’s ability
to maintain discipline and control because
vandalism is difficult to attribute to individual
inmates 

 :
However, these arguments assume a limited measure
of control on the part of the officer and/or
the absence of staff in the unit during most of the
day and night (remote observation or linear surveillance) 
A well-run housing unit, with a staff
member presenthours a day, that is designed
to provide the maximum amount of vision into
all areas of the unit will generally mitigate or
eliminate the concerns expressed above 
Electronic Monitoring Versus Staff Monitoring
Audio monitoring and CCTV have their place in
the jail security system, but such equipment is
effective only when staff are provided to monitor
the systems and summon assistanceOften,
surveillance equipment is installed, but staffing
is not appropriately allocated to monitor it, thus
compromising its effectivenessIn addition to
the staff assigned to monitor the electronic systems,
other staff must be available to respond
to inappropriate inmate behavior detected by
the electronic surveillancePersonal supervision
by trained staff should be provided in all jails,
regardless of the electronic tools used to supplement
itElectronic monitoring should be used
to enhance rather than supplant staff functions 
The appropriate blending of staff and technology
should be reinforced during the transition process 
Work Environment
A key fact to remember when creating the jail
environment is that it is not only an inmate environment
but a staff environmentBuildings
contain behaviorStaff control inmate behavior 
Indeed, the jail is more of a staff work environment,
in that the average officer works in the facility
over a period of years, whereas the average
inmate stays only about – days 
Additionally, jails often experience a major problem
with staff turnoverMuch of it has to do
with salary and career opportunities, but some
of it has to do with very poor and stressful work
conditions in older jailsConsequently, designs
developed with staff in mind may help eliminate
this trend and even set in motion improvements
in other areas 
Staff-oriented considerations include the
following:
 Personal safety and security 
 Ease of movement and ease of general
job performance 
 Pleasantness of environment:
Natural light 
Artificial light 
Sound 
Color 
Ventilation 
 Control over personal environment, especially
staff posts 
 Amenities 
 Lockers and showers 
 Training areas 
 Lounge/break room 
 Exercise facilities 
 Parking 
Conclusion
It is important to remember that the design of the
facility can greatly enhance the ability of staff to
do their jobs effectively and safelyConversely, a
poorly planned facility can create problems with
facility operations and the management of inmate
behaviorSpending the time to develop a wellthought-
out operational plan and working with
the planners and architects to design a facility

C h a p t e r :
S t a f f i n g I m p a c t
that achieves the goal of safety and security for
staff and inmates is the key to developing a facility
that can be safely operated using an appropriate
number of staff 
It is also important to remember that there is no
one-size-fits-all staffing plan, and it is incumbent
on each agency to take the time necessary to collect
accurate and complete staffing information to
ensure staffing decisions are made based on desired
operations for the new facility and real data
that can be used to justify those decisions

Security Perimeter
Escape and contraband are deeply troubling
words to sheriffs and jail administrators 
They represent the manifestation of basic
security defects within the jail’s physical plant
or problems with its operationNew jail design
approaches, hardware technology, and improved
training for jail staff during the recent past have
reduced, but not eliminated, problems of escape,
contraband passage, and related breaches in jail
security 
Many breaches in jail security result from human
error in recruitment, selection, and supervision
of jail staff or a lack of adequate training and
written policies and proceduresSome escapes
early in the life of a new jail occur because staff
were inadequately trained in the new building’s
control equipment, which is frequently more
complex than that found in the old jailHowever,
even the most elite correctional staff cannot be
expected to make an inadequately designed and
equipped jail consistently secure through staff effort
aloneThey must rely, to some extent, on the
integrity of the materials, hardware, and design
to complement effective security procedures 
The failure to define and establish, through planning
and design, a clearly identifiable and reliable
security perimeter (envelope) is a primary
contributor to problems in small and mediumsized
jailsArchitecture, operational procedures,
and technology are elements of jail security 
Equipment, materials, and design decisions are
influenced by the nature of the inmate population
and are oriented toward basic security objectives 
Thisdescribes an overall approach
to security and recommends measures to enhance
jail security 
Ingredients of Security
Security systems engineers and analysts have
identified four major ingredients involved in
providing building security: denial, detection,
response, and assessment 
 DenialIn practical terms, denial means that
the building is designed to restrict inmate access
to unauthorized internal areas or the outside;
provide physical separation for various
inmate classifications (e g , separate housing
for inmate workers); control inmate movement
through the use of sallyports, staff supervision,
and other means; and eliminate the potential
for the passage of contraband in the jail by
building and maintaining a secure perimeter 
 DetectionIf the denial element fails or is
compromised (e g , a lock malfunctions or
security glass is penetrated), then detection is
necessaryDetection in jails often comes about
through regular inmate counts or random cell
checks and searches that reveal an escape or
contrabandDetection might also mean that
an officer observes an inmate scaling a fence
or bolting through a door to an unsecured
areaIn modern jails, detection can involve
sophisticated technology such as perimetersensing
devices to detect attempts at escape
or intrusion 
 ResponseAfter detection and assessment,
the response is the action taken by staff to
counteract the problemIn addition to sending
staff to the affected area, this may include triggering
alarms, lighting selected areas, closing
gates, and initiating evacuation procedures 
 AssessmentAssessment is simply an evaluation
of the problem that has been detectedIt
is largely a matter of determining the nature

 :
and degree of a situation (e g , escape attempt,
window tampering, unauthorized movement
in a secure zone)Assessment may or may not
be made with the assistance of sophisticated
technology 
Design Focus
The focus during jail planning is on the fundamental
design features and the staffing required
for effective denial, detection, response, and assessment 
Detection, response, and assessment
primarily require the involvement of staff, supplemented
by technologies such as closed-circuit
television (CCTV), motion detection, audio monitoring,
and remote control of locks, lights, and
alarmsStaff can be helped to effectively do their
job in these areas by operational decisions and
building designs that use constant and effective
staff surveillance or supervision of all inmateoccupied
or inmate-utilized areas, routes of
egress, and the exterior of the facility 
Thisis devoted to the fundamental design
features that provide the ingredient of denial 
Denial of escape and contraband passage is
fundamentally accommodated in the design of
the physical plant in the following ways:
 Creating an overall barrier, commonly referred
to as a “security perimeter,” that precludes
contraband passage from the outside and unauthorized
access to and egress from the jail 
 Creating internal security zones that preclude
escape and contraband passage within the jail
by controlling internal movement and maintaining
separation between key activities and
inmate-occupied areas, especially those that
house inmates who pose the greatest risk of
escape or contraband passage according to the
facility’s classification plan(See ,
“Classification/Separation ”)
Perimeters and Zones
The different kinds of perimeters and zones that
might be created to assist staff in denying escape
and contraband passage are described below 
Main security perimeter
The main security perimeter is the fundamental
barrier that is intended to preclude escape, unauthorized
ingress or egress, and contraband passage 
It might best be thought of as a security
envelope because the main security perimeter is a
three-dimensional rather than a two-dimensional
elementThat is, it consists of the ceilings, roofs,
and floors, as well as the exterior and interior
walls, doors, passthroughs, and windows, which
help deny escape or contraband passage from
the outside 
Secondary security perimeter
The secondary security perimeter is a wall, security
fence, or other support elements that complement
the main security perimeter of the jailThis
element normally consists of fences that define
large outdoor exercise or farm and garden areas
and that inhibit (though not necessarily prohibit)
access to the main security perimeterIt may also
consist of walls that create controlled exterior
spaces to preclude view as well as inhibit access 
These perimeter fences and walls do not create a
three-dimensional security envelope 
Primary internal security zones
Primary internal security zones are threedimensional
areas within the main security
perimeter that provide for basic security separation
and control of primary movement routes
within the jail, denying or delaying access to
other zonesTypical examples of primary security
zones in a jail include:

C h a p t e r :
S e c u r i t y P e r i m e t e r
 Master control 
 Housing pods or areas 
 Female housing areas 
 Special housing areas, especially those for
work release or periodically confined inmates 
 Program and support service areas 
 Visiting areas, especially those accessible to
the public 
Access to these zones is typically controlled remotely
by master controlIn some cases, selected
primary internal security zones coincide with fire
and smoke containment zones within the overall
structure 
Secondary internal security zones
Secondary internal security zones are threedimensional
areas within both the main security
perimeter and the primary internal security
zones (exhibit)Their purpose is typically to
preclude unauthorized and uncontrolled access
between functional components (e g , laundry
and food services) or between areas that are part
of functional components (e g , separate housing
units) within a primary internal security zone 
Access to these zones is typically controlled remotely
by master control or either remotely or
directly by other facility staff

Zoning may go to a third level because individual
spaces, such as cells and medication storage,
frequently require fully secure protection from
outside intrusion, escape attempts, and uncontrolled
access within a secondary internal security
zoneThese spaces might be referred to as
“tertiary internal security zones ”
Building Areas Outside the Security Envelope
The overall building envelope is virtually never
the same as the security envelope of the jail 
There are functions outside of the jail security
envelope that often share the building and contribute
to the effectiveness of jail operationsTypically,
these include the sheriff’s law enforcement
functions and, possibly, court and probation
functionsFor these nonjail functions to share the
building with the jail effectively, their needs must
be recognized, their interrelationship with the jail
understood, and their components integrated into
the design in a way that avoids security conflicts 
These issues are examined more closely in 
 , “Criminal Justice Interface ”
Jail-related functions that need to be outside of
the primary jail security envelope (like the lobby
or jail administration) also share the overall
building envelope (exhibit)Access to some
or all of these areas may be controlled by jail
staff within the security envelope

 :
The most common functions affiliated with the
jail, but outside its main security envelope, are
the public lobby, the night lobby/vestibule, and
the jail administration and staff areas (these can
be provided in association with the law enforcement
area)These public areas require different
levels of access controlNonjail spaces should be
grouped depending on the type of access control
required:
 Uncontrolled public areasThese areas consist
of spaces to which the public has unrestricted
access, although they may be monitored by
direct observation from a constantly staffed
post and/or by electronic means (CCTV and/
or audio)Spaces that frequently fall into this
category are the main lobby and its affiliated
spaces (e g , public restrooms, property locker
areas) and the night lobby/vestibule 
 Periodically controlled areasThese are areas
to which the public has unrestricted access
only during portions of the dayAt other times,
access is precluded and controlled by jail staff
(usually master control) or by law enforcement
staff (normally the dispatcher)The public
lobby and its affiliated spaces can fall into
this category, especially when a night lobby/
vestibule is incorporated to accommodate unrestricted
public contact after visiting and office
hours 
 Controlled access areasThese are areas to
which public access must be controlled or
restricted at all timesThe jail administration
area is the main example of a set of spaces to
which the public must have access only in a
controlled and regulated wayThe staff spaces
(lockers, training, and exercise) are normally
within this area because public access should
be restricted 
Design Considerations
Following are design considerations for the development
of the main security envelope and the
internal security zones essential to the denial of
escape, unauthorized access, and contraband
passageMore information on the security development
of different functional components
and spaces within functional components can be
found in section, “Functional Components ”
General Considerations
Overlapping perimeters/zones
Because of the nature of internal zoning, the
floors, walls, and/or roof areas that define internal
zones and the main security envelope frequently
overlapFor example, the exterior wall of
an individual cell, which may be defined as part
of a tertiary internal security zone, is frequently
also the wall of the housing unit (secondary security
zone), the general population male housing
area (primary security zone), and the jail as a
whole (main security envelope)In such a case,
it is critical to design the wall according to the
needs of the most stringent security condition—
in this case, those of the main security envelope 
In the same example, however, the ceiling of the
cell might not coincide, or overlap, with that
of other zonesThis is because the security demands
of the cell, or tertiary zone, might require
the use of a securely constructed ceiling (concrete,
steel, cement plaster on metal lath) that
precludes access to a roof system aboveIf the
roof system is securely constructed, it may serve
separately as part of the main security perimeter
or part of a secondary or a primary security
zoneIn another instance, the cell may be located
under another cell sharing the same two-tier
housing unit, or under a floor of another internal
security zone

S e c u r i t y P e r i m e t e r
Impact on design
The primary reason for establishing a main security
perimeter (envelope) and internal security
zones is basic facility safety and securityHowever,
an important architectural and economic
benefit also accrues: development of a sound
security envelope and effective internal zones
allows wider latitude in the development of individual
internal spaces in terms of material finishes,
hardware, and furniture selectionThis
is especially true when perimeter and zoning
concepts are coupled with a well-developed
classification/separation plan and with concepts
of constant staff presence and surveillance, thus
providing detection, assessment, and response
capabilities 
For example, if the main security envelope and
the primary internal security zone of a housing
area consisting of several housing units are well
defined and properly designed, as well as constantly
observed by staff, some of the following
options and associated cost savings might become
available 
 Less heavily reinforced and constructed partitions
and less costly security glazing to separate
housing-unit dayrooms from the zone
corridor because the zone is clearly defined
and controlled, offering little gain to inmates
penetrating the wall 
 Less costly doors, frames, hardware, and locks
on general-population cells because there is
little to be gained by penetration 
 Less costly dayroom ceiling materials because
penetration offers no viable escape route from
the zone 
 Elimination of costly security vestibules at the
entry to housing units because escape from the
individual unit is contained within the primary
housing area security zone 
 Elimination of costly enclosed housing control
posts because assaultive behavior by inmates
will not result in egress from the primary
housing area security zone 
In evaluating these types of options, the issue of
durability should not be neglected, nor should
it be forgotten that physical security is still a
required ingredientFrom an operational viewpoint,
good perimeter and good internal zoning
may also allow for unescorted inmate movement
between different points in the facility without
fear of a successful escape attemptAn example
would be unescorted movement between housing
and visiting zones 
Master control
A key consideration in the development of an effective
security envelope and effective internal
security zones is creation of a master control
positionThis position, which must be a primary
internal security zone in its own right, must be
able to:
Housing unit within the secure perimeter and primary internal security
zone with solid-core wood doors, nonfixed furnishings, and open officer’s
station 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )

 :
 Monitor all security systems (e g , CCTV,
alarms, pressure-sensitive motion detectors) 
 Communicate with, control and monitor, and
observe people at all ingress/egress points in
the main security envelope 
 Communicate with, control and monitor, and
observe people at the doors or gates that help
define internal security zones and inhibit
movement between them 
 Communicate with facility staff, wherever they
are located in the facility 
 Control entry into the master control space 
(Note: An emergency key should be kept outside
the facility’s security perimeter to open
the room if the officer becomes incapacitated )
 Facilitate efficient staff and inmate movement
throughout the facility 
More on the design of this space can be found in
 , “Master Control ”
Compatibility of construction
In creating the security envelope and internal
security zones, it is important that materials, finishes,
and hardware in perimeter and zone barriers
are compatible and comparableFor example,
it is not helpful to provide glass-clad polycarbonate
glazing material (a very high security window
material) when the base wall consists of gypsum
board (standard drywall)Similarly, it is inappropriate
to provide a high-security lock for a lightweight
hollow metal door and door frameOther
incompatible elements are concrete floors and
reinforced concrete masonry unit walls combined
with lightweight suspended metal acoustic ceiling
panels that lead to unsecured ceiling plenums
(the space between ceilings and roofs) 
Security above the zone
One often-overlooked consideration in the development
of the security envelope and internal
security zones is security above the space or
area that is being defined as a zone or envelope 
Failing to realize that the envelope and zones
are three-dimensional, planners often give inadequate
attention to the development of the ceiling
in relation to the ceiling plenum and the roof as
a key element of the envelope or zoneThere are
several considerations in this regard:
 The ceiling of a space should be securely constructed
if the walls around the zone do not
extend to the roof or construction above and/
or if the roof or construction above is not secured
(exhibit) 
 The ceiling should be securely constructed
regardless of the nature of the roof or construction
above and regardless of the degree
to which the walls exceed the ceiling line if
elements in the ceiling (e g , electrical lines,
water lines, ductwork) need protection or if
access to the plenum is intolerable under any
circumstance 
 Openings in a secure ceiling should be
sized and designed to preclude unwanted
penetration 
Main Security Envelope

the main security envelope of the jailThe main

and contraband passage and must be constructed
with the assumption that extremely dangerous
and sophisticated criminals may be held in the
jailEscape and contraband passage are constant
risks that can be initiated by individual inmates
or in conjunction with outside collaboratorsThe
preservation of a safe environment inside the jail
and the prevention of assisted escapes or contraband
passage from the outside require strict control
over all penetrations of the security envelope 
A variety of design considerations to prevent escapes
and contraband passage pertain to the development
of the main security envelope:
 Limited access pointsThe number of access
points must be limited to the minimum necessary
for the efficient operation of the building,
separation of conflicting traffic flows, and compliance
with life safety codesThe fewer entry
and exit points into the building, the fewer
chances that security at these areas will be
compromisedMinimum access points needed
in a security perimeter to properly control traffic
flow and satisfy codes include:
Main public access to visiting and program
areas 
Staff access to the perimeter, which may be
the same as the public access, although this
may not be desirable 
Arrestee/arresting officer access 
Access for delivery of food/supplies and
garbage removal 
Required points of emergency egress 
 Security vestibule with interlocking doorsAll
access points into the main security perimeter
should be through a security vestibule with interlocking
doors that allow for override of the
interlock by master control during an emergency
(exhibit) 
E x h i b i t Security Vestibule

Interlock doors Entry
 Key override capabilityAccess points into the
main security perimeter should have a key
override capabilityKeys to these doors should
be under the direct control of the master control
officer and should never be removed from
the master control area except in an emergency 
However, it is sometimes desirable to keep
a master key in a secure location outside the
secure perimeter (most frequently the sheriff’s
office) in case of an equipment failure or other
emergency in master control 
 Metal detectorsMetal detectors should be
available at all access points used by the public
and outside service providers and, depending
on the policy of the jail administration, at
access points used by jail staff and other officials 
Metal detectors can be integrated into
the architecture of the facility in ways that
hide them from viewAlthough the integrated
detectors may be more visually appealing,
the use of freestanding or hand-held detectors
might be more of a deterrent at access points 
 Secure construction of access pointsAll access
points should be securely constructedFollowing
are some examples:
Swing or sliding doors of or -gauge
steel 

 :
Frames grouted and anchored securely to
the wall 
High-security detention-grade locks and
hardware 
Windows, if used, that employ the strongest
security glass products 
Walls, floors, and ceilings that are securely
constructed and create their own threedimensional
security zone 
 Use of impenetrable materialsThe materials
and construction methods used for the envelope
must be relatively impenetrable, even
from sustained attack with toolsFor example:
❏ Floors: concrete with various finishes 
Walls: precast or cast-in-place concrete; concrete
masonry units reinforced and grouted
every toinches on center 
Ceilings: precast or cast-in-place concrete;
steel security panels; cement plaster on expanded
metal lath 
Roof: precast or cast-in-place concrete with
built-up roofing membrane; heavy-gauge
metal deck securely fixed in place with roofing
membrane 
Windows: typically inoperable unless heavily
screened with security-grade products;
and constructed with the strongest security,
detention grade glass products available and
securely anchored 
 Secured openingsOther types of openings into
the main security envelope (other than the access
points) should be securedFor example:
Passthroughs for such things as packages,
money, and mail 
Ductwork 
Electrical openings 
Roof fan openings 
Secured windows in an indoor recreation yardNote that these windows
open for air circulation but have security mesh to prevent penetration 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )
Air supply grills 
Skylights 
In general, these openings or penetrations in
the walls, ceilings, and roof of the main security
perimeter should not exceed inches
in one dimension unless the opening can be
confined to an area of x inches or less 
Openings exceeding these dimensional limits
should be protected by steel bars or other
security elements that effectively reduce the
size of the opening 
 Limited public viewPublic view of inmate living
or activity areas must be limited as much
as possibleTechniques to accomplish this and
still provide natural light to inmate-occupied
areas are discussed in , “Site Selection
and Design ”
Secured outdoor exercise areasOutdoor exercise
areas traditionally present special problems
for security envelope design, including at
least five typical concerns:

Eliminating view conflicts and physical
contact with the public 

C h a p t e r :
S e c u r i t y P e r i m e t e r
Controlling the introduction of contraband
from outside sources 
Preventing intrusion or escape through, under,
or over the exercise area fence or wall 
Providing a means of egress from the area if
it is to serve as a containment area for facility
evacuations 
Outdoor exercise areas represent a particularly
vulnerable point in the main security
envelope, and special care must be taken during
the design effort to close potential holes 
Related design considerations are addressed
in, “Exercise Areas ”
 Use of CCTVCCTV monitoring systems can
provide some control over the exterior of the
main security perimeterIf CCTV is used, several
considerations apply:
The number of cameras should be minimized
to facilitate effective monitoring by
master control 
Recesses and pockets in the exterior of the
building should be minimized to reduce the
number of cameras and monitors required
and facilitate a better exterior view 
Cameras should be placed in locations inaccessible
to public contact and potential
tampering 
Cameras should be able to accommodate
changes in light level (day-night), where
applicable 
Cameras with swivel and zoom features are
desirable, to allow master control to focus
on specific areas on the perimeter 
If a CCTV system is used, monitoring of the
rooftop should be considered, especially if
the facility is a single-story structureBuilding
rooftops should be as clear of obstructions as
possibleDesigns can discourage access
to the roof via downspouts, light fixtures,
and other elements that protrude from the
exterior 
 Use of perimeter lightingPerimeter lighting is
a useful feature for discouraging approaches to
the security envelope by the public or persons
collaborating with inmates on escape attempts 
 Secured access to mechanical rooms, buildings,
or penthousesAccess to these areas should be
secured at both the outside and inside access
points to the rest of the jail 
 Security-sensitive landscapingFacility landscaping
must be considered in light of overall
security designAll shrubs and trees should
be placed to ensure that sightlines to the perimeter
are not obscuredThey should not
be positioned where they can be used by an
intruder to scale perimeter walls and fences 
Landscaping may be useful to help preclude
approaches to the exterior (tough, thorny
bushes, for example) 
 Climate-controlled heating, ventilating, and
air-conditioning (HVAC) systemInstallation of
a fully climate-controlled HVAC system should
be considered to avoid the need for operable
windows 
 Limited access for inmate visitorsThe design
should limit inmate visitors to a primary
internal security zone created for visitation
purposes adjacent to the public lobby (exhibit
 )Contact visits, if permitted, should occur
in a designated area within this zone under
staff supervision 
Special considerations for denying contraband
Most of the preceding design considerations that
help deny escapes fundamentally help deny contraband
passage from outside partiesHowever,
contraband can be introduced into the facility

by inmates and others entering the main security
envelopeThree types of inmates are usually
involved:
 The escorted inmate who acquires contraband
while outside the main security envelope (e g ,
in court or at a medical appointment)Contraband
enters the jail when officers returning the
inmate fail to perform an adequate clothed or
unclothed search prior to returning the inmate
to his/her housing area 
 The work releasee, or inmate worker who has
outside privileges and is not subject to search
each time he/she reenters the main security
perimeter of the facilityThis is especially
problematic if work release inmates do not
have a separate entrance into the facility or are
not housed separately from general population
inmates 
 Inmates who come in contact with outside
parties such as attorneys, counselors, or contract
food service workers who either inadvertently
or purposely pass contraband 
Design features that can be incorporated to reduce
the risk of contraband passage include:
 Separate entrywaysSeparate entry and exit
should be provided for work releasees and
inmate workers, who both provide a natural
chain of contraband passageIf separate entryways
are not achievable, staff will have to
control opportunities for contact and passage
of contraband 
 Separate clothing exchange areasSeparate areas
should be provided in which inmate workers
and work releasees can leave potentially
contaminated clothing and personal items and
dress in institutional clothing prior to returning
to a secure housing area 
 Separate housing areasThe housing areas of
work releasees should be clearly separated
from those of inmate workers by locating the
two in separate primary internal security zones
and precluding one group from entering the
zone of the other 
 Separate laundry facilities for work releasees 
Work release inmates should have separate
laundry facilitiesProviding work releasees
with separate facilities for exercise, visiting,
and other activities might also be considered
unless staff action can minimize contraband
passage opportunities 
 VestibulesVestibules allow all escorted inmates,
work releasees, and inmate workers to
be searched at reentryWhere inmate workers
are involved in receiving and storing food or
packaging refuse, creating an enclosed delivery
vestibule and refuse storage area is a good
ideaSuch an area would use a system of interlocking
doors observed by CCTV from master
control and/or directly by staff 
 Separate work areas for inmate workersAll
activities and work functions of inmate workers
(e g , food preparation, laundry) should be
located inside the main security envelope and
outside of primary internal security zones provided
for inmate housing 
 Pedestrian entrance vestibulesThese vestibules
should be designed to avoid hiding

C h a p t e r :
S e c u r i t y P e r i m e t e r
places that could be used for concealment and
later retrieval of contraband during entry and
exit by inmates 
 Exterior doorsThe doors used should seal
tightly to prevent the introduction of contraband
under the door or between the frame and
the door 
 Secure routes to court facilitiesOpportunities
for public contact should be eliminated or
minimized 
 Secure space for interviewingSpace for interviewing
inmates should be provided within the
main security envelope rather than outside the
envelope in jail administration or law enforcement
areas 
 Search roomsProviding search rooms allows
inmates to be checked as they depart from different
areas of the facility to their housing unit
after contact with others 
 Metal detectionMetal detection equipment
should be located at key points of entry
through which all visitors must pass under the
supervision of an officer 
Perimeter Fences/Walls
The perimeter fencing most commonly found at
jails built on large parcels of land in nonurban
areas typically consists of two parallel fences
around the entire institutionThe only openings
in the fences are at the public entry near the administration
portion of the building and at a vehicle
entry pointSome distance between the two
fences is necessary to prevent jumping from the
top of one fence over the other or using instruments
(e g , ropes, ladders) to bridge from one
fence to the otherThe space between the two
fences also allows for the placement of security
wire to inhibit movement if the first fence is penetrated
or scaled 
For the jail that is a single discrete building, the
need for such a perimeter fence or wall is less
clear than for large facilities that have multiple
buildings and high levels of required outdoor
inmate movementIn the majority of jails, most
or all inmate housing activities and movement
occur within the secure envelope of the physical
plant, negating the need to physically contain
outdoor movement 
There are, however, reasons that a perimeter
fence or wall around some or all of a jail makes
sense:
 There may be concerns regarding the jail’s immediate
adjacency to sensitive public areas
that justify additional separation or screening,
such as schools, playgrounds, parks, nursing
homes, or densely populated areas 
 The amount and type of inmate activity occurring
outside the jail building, such as inmate
gardening, groundskeeping, building maintenance,
and field recreation, might require a
fenced enclosure 
In most instances, a single fence rather than a
double fence makes sense, especially if inmates
do not have access to the outdoor areas or if only
a few inmates use the areas and they are directly
supervised by staffIf view conflicts are perceived
or the appearance of a fence is objectionable,
a perimeter wall would be more appropriate
but probably more costly 
If a perimeter fence or wall is incorporated into
the building plan, several design characteristics
should be considered:
 A minimum height of approximatelyfeet 
 If a fence is used, a tightly woven mesh or
wire to inhibit climbing 

 :
 Security wire (e g , razor wire) at the top of
the fence or wall (in the case of a wall, the
security wire might be just behind the wall out
of public view for aesthetic purposes) 
 An ability to observe all portions of the area
defined by the fence, especially if inmates are
to use the area (by a direct view from a constantly
staffed post, by CCTV, or by both) 
 An extension of the fence or wall below grade
to preclude tunneling under it 
 Perimeter lighting to enhance nighttime surveillance
and to discourage assaults from the
outside during the night 
Internal Security Zones
Primary internal security zones incorporate the
following key principles into facility design and
operation:
 Ingress and egress are regulated and monitored
by direct visual or CCTV observation from a
master control center 
 All movement of people and materials from
one zone to another is restricted and controlled
by strategic placement of corridor gates
or doors remotely operated by master control 
 All out-of-cell inmate activities in the zones
are directly supervised, observed from a constantly
staffed post, or monitored by CCTV 
 A secure three-dimensional envelope is created,
similar in construction to that of the
main security perimeter, although the zone
can frequently share elements with the security
envelope 
One key aspect of defining primary internal security
zones is to achieve a proper balance between
security needs and efficiencyIt is possible to
subdivide the jail into so many zones that movement
of staff and inmates becomes difficult and
burdensomeOne consequence of doing so is that
staff prop open doors that are meant to be closed
and are indicated as closed on control panel annunciators 
Thus, the value of sophisticated control
technologies is contravened and concepts of
zoning and movement control break down 
Jail with dual fenced perimeter with razor wire

Secondary internal security zones incorporate the
following key principles into facility design and
operation:
 Ingress and egress are regulated and monitored
by master control or another officer through
locked doors that may be operated either remotely
or manually 
 Inmate activities in the zones may be supervised
or unsupervised, depending on the risk
level of the inmates in the zones 
 Construction and material approaches for
secondary, and even tertiary, internal security
zones might be less secure than those for the
main security envelope and primary internal
security zones, although needs vary on a
space-by-space basis 

C h a p t e r :
S e c u r i t y P e r i m e t e r
For example, the security needs of a medication
storage space or a disciplinary detention cell,
both of which might be defined as tertiary security
zones, may well demand construction similar
to that of a primary zoneConversely, the indoor
exercise area, as a secondary internal security
zone, would typically not require construction
as heavy or as secure as a primary zone or the
main security envelope unless a portion of it
(wall, ceiling/roof) coincided with a higher level
perimeter 
Readers are advised to examine the data on individual
functional components presented in
section and assess the implications for security
construction 
Conclusion
Accurately defining and creating security envelopes
and zones is essential in an architecturally
secure facilityEffective development of envelopes
and zones is also one of the key spaceorganizing
principles of a jail designTo be fully
effective, however, the architectural concepts
must complement and, in fact, derive from fully
developed operational principles regarding inmate
classification and separation, supervision
and surveillance, staffing, and basic policies and
procedures of operationsIf a true marriage between
security design and operations is achieved,
the jail’s basic mission of ensuring exterior and
interior security will be achieved 

C h a p t e r
Criminal Justice Interface
Ajail does not operate in a vacuumIt is
only one part of a larger, interrelated criminal
justice systemOfficials from other
elements of the system interact with jail inmates
and staff on a daily basis, and jail designs need
to enhance the effectiveness of these interactions 
This section identifies ways in which other criminal
justice system participants interface with the
jail 
The system elements that have the most interaction
with the jail include:
 Affiliated law enforcement agencies, most
typically the sheriff’s office and local police
departments 
 Courts 
 Defense and prosecuting attorneys 
 Probation and parole 
A General Caution
Establishing proper interface between the jail
and other elements of the criminal justice system
entails more than just making sure inmates get
to court or see an attorneySometimes design
processes get so focused on solving jail facility
problems that they inadvertently create problems
for law enforcement, probation, court, and other
related functions 
This problem is especially acute when the jail
facility shares a site with other criminal justice
functionsSpecifically, jurisdictions have expanded
jails in less-than-desirable ways on existing
sites solely because the courts are also there 
These solutions have often ignored the growth
needs of the courthouse or its fundamental inadequacy
as a modern, secure court facility 
Then, when the jurisdiction later turns its attention
to court needs, it discovers that the available
space on the site is inadequate and that solutions
require either a new facility or an additional facility
at a different locationThe jurisdiction is left
with the worst of all worlds: higher costs for the
court solution, no interconnection between the
jail and courts, and a jail design that was compromised
by erroneous site considerations 
To avoid this scenario, jurisdictions should consider
taking the following steps during predesign
planning for the jail:
 Develop a broad understanding of facility,
parking, and operational needs of related criminal
justice functions 
 If possible, develop a criminal justice facilities
master plan so that the jail project fits into a
clearly understood present and future context 
 Invite criminal justice officials to be routinely
involved in jail planning meetings 
 Before using a shared site, develop sketch
work that shows how the site will accommodate
the jail design, jail expansion, expansion
of the other facilities at the site, and all related
parking needs 
 Evaluate jail options at varying distances
from the site to test actual functional and
cost differences—it may be that a new location
would not be as detrimental as staying on the
courthouse site 
Law Enforcement Interface
Most county jails are organizationally a part of
the local sheriff’s departmentIn practical terms,
while larger facilities may be built in suburban
or rural areas, some distance from the sheriff’s

 :
office, virtually all smaller jail facilities
are constructed in combination
with a sheriff’s administrative, road
patrol, civil, and dispatch functions 
The close administrative and arrestprocessing
ties between law enforcement and
jail operations frequently result in a blurring of
distinctions between the two different functional
needsFor example, in smaller jails, law enforcement
communications/dispatch staff are often
responsible for control and electronic monitoring
of jail areas, and the kitchen in some jails is the
break area for law enforcement staff 
Although some sharing of staff and space can be
successfully planned and designed, experience
has shown jail resources are frequently used to
compensate for insufficient law enforcement provisions 
The most frequent complaints relate to
provisions for storage and/or staff supportMany
jurisdictions find they need to reassign some jail
space for law enforcement use to relieve critical
deficiencies, creating a twofold problem:
 Space planned for jail use is lost, thereby recreating
some of the same overcrowded or deficient
jail conditions that originally prompted
new construction 
 The reassigned spaces are not efficiently
located, requiring law enforcement staff to
regularly move in and out of the jail security
envelope for nonjail purposesThis increases
the workload for jail control staff and potentially
generates security concernsSecure jail
operations require a specific security envelope
that restricts and controls access of all nonjail
persons and activitiesThis concept of control
should include nonjail sheriff’s department
staff 
The principal reason space shortages exist in
new law enforcement components seems to be
that most of the focus was on the jail throughout
the facility development process—a logical thing
when one considers the controversies that frequently
propel jail projectsThe solution? Treat
both the jail and law enforcement functions more
equally, beginning with a solid review of how
they interrelate 
When the jail facility is jointly constructed with
law enforcement spaces, a number of spacesharing
concepts can be considered in both the
jail and law enforcement areasSpace sharing
can help eliminate duplication of resources while
providing a comprehensive facility plan at minimal
construction costThese issues and their design
implications are discussed next 
The success of the jail design can, to some extent,
depend on the successful planning and
design of adjacent nonjail areasThe following
issues, while not dealing with law enforcement
design per se, focus on the design of key law enforcement
elements that interface with the jail:
public/staff separation, law enforcement dispatch
and jail control in small jails, records, arrest processing,
investigations and lineups, jail administration
and staff, food service, and deliveries 
Public/Staff Separation
The organization of jail building and site designs
frequently focuses on separation of staff, law enforcement,
and public access, including parking,
staff entry, arrestee entry, visitor entry, service
delivery access, and so forthLaw enforcement
functions need to be similarly separatedCoordinating
these separations during initial site
utilization studies can create the basis for better
separation of public from nonpublic areas and
possibly yield a more efficient shared public lobby
and unified staff parking area (exhibit) 
Law Enforcement Dispatch and Jail Control
in Small Jails
Jurisdictions with smaller sheriff’s
departments and jails may use staff in
the dual role of jail master control

C h a p t e r :
C r i m i n a l J u s t i c e I n t e r f a c e
officer and law enforcement communications/
dispatch officerWhether this operational practice
can, or should, continue is a critical decision in
developing a small jail designIt is rarely an issue
or option for mediumand large-scale facilities 
The expectations for staff monitoring of inmate
activities in new jails and the sophisticated building
and security electronics systems in these jails
dramatically increase the tasks and responsibilities
of jail staff when compared with systems in
older jailsWhere population growth is a factor,
the increasing volume of communication calls
alone may dictate separate dispatch staffTo assess
the issues involving the master control jail
position and communications dispatch, see

Care should be taken in the selection of staff
used in this dual function to avoid the problems
that can arise when staff trained as dispatchers
are thrust into a jail control role they do not want
and that they perform reluctantly and ineffectively 
In designs where the master control/
dispatch center is strategically located to visually
monitor and control a series of jail spaces and
activities around it, dispatch staff frequently cut
off the views by placing blinds or curtains over
the vision panels, which can create a dangerous
situationIn these instances, the use of trained
correctional officers in the dual role is essential 
When communications/dispatch operations are
to be combined with the master control space,
the space may need to be located adjacent to or
closely connected to the records area and/or the
public lobby (exhibit)Dispatchers in small
agencies frequently need access to records information
not available in electronic data systems 
They also frequently respond directly to citizen
requests for assistance, especially during evening
and weekend hours

Records
When law enforcement and the jail share the
same building, records storage and retrieval functions
must be organized to ensure that both entities
can access files easilyThe active, hardcopy
files for inmates should be created and stored in
the jail until an inmate is released or transferred 
The physical transfer of those files to a central
records area requires little more than the design
of a staff access route between the jail and law
enforcement records areas or the creation of another
means, like a pneumatic tube system 

 :
Arrest Processing
The chief interface between law enforcement and
the jail is the transfer of custody of an arrestee
from local police, state police, or sheriff’s deputies
to the jail staffThis is a daily occurrence
that the jail design must easily accommodate 
An enclosed vehicle sallyport for entry of the arrestee
and arresting officer is virtually standard
in modern jailsBeyond that, provisions for the
arresting officers should also include the following
(exhibit):
E x h i b i t Provisions for Arresting Officers
Report
Intakewriting
release
Weapons
lockers
CCTV camera
to master control
Vehicle sallyport
Pedestrian entry
 Weapons lockers in the vehicle sallyport 
 An exterior pedestrian entry through which an
officer can reenter after moving his/her vehicle
out of the sallyport or can park outside and
walk the arrestee into the booking area 
 Visual monitoring by intake-release and/or
master control staff of the entire arrestee route,
in case the arresting officer needs assistance 
 A work area/security vestibule that provides
a secure entry point through the jail’s security
envelope as well as a place for law enforcement
officers to do pat searches, take property,
and complete prebooking paperwork 
 Sobriety testing equipment in or adjacent to
the work area/vestibule 
 Interview/interrogation space 
 
 Quick access to a temporary holding room for
uncooperative arrestees or for processing multiple
arrests 
These provisions should all be located adjacent
to the intake-release area in a way that does not
require the arresting officer to go beyond the
entry vestibule and deeper into the jail security
envelopeFor more information on this topic, see
 , “Intake-Release,” in section 
Investigations and Lineups
Local and state law enforcement officers frequently
need to interview jail inmatesTo alleviate
security concerns with inmate movement,
interview space can be provided within or directly
adjacent to the jail security envelopeIf scheduling
conflicts can be avoided, space used for law
enforcement interviews can often be shared with
the areas used for attorney visits and other professional
visits 
Some departments indicate a periodic need for a
lineup room for victim/witness identification of
arresteesThis should be located so as to minimize
public penetration of the jail and securely
separate victim/witness movement from that of
inmatesGiven the limited use of lineup facilities,
these spaces are prime candidates for multipleuse
considerationIf located within the security
envelope, the lineup room may also be used for
inmate counseling, library, or religious services 
If the space is located along the security envelope,
extra care should be taken in selecting the

C h a p t e r :
C r i m i n a l J u s t i c e I n t e r f a c e
type of security glass used to separate inmates
from the nonsecure side 
Jail Administration and Staff
Space for the jail administrator, clerical activities,
conferences, staff training, and staff lockers and
showers does not necessarily need to be within
the jail security envelopeWhen law enforcement
offices are built in conjunction with the
jail, creation of one administrative and staff area
can minimize expensive secure space and eliminate
unnecessary duplication of spacesClerical,
conference, and jail administration activities can
take place in the same areaFor example, with
proper scheduling the same space can be used
as a training classroom for both correctional officers
and law enforcement officersJail and law
enforcement staff locker areas can be combined
outside the secure jail envelope with joint-use
toilet and shower facilitiesHowever, when these
staff and administrative spaces are shared by
both jail and law enforcement staff, care must
be taken to ensure that there are adequate space
and equal amenities (e g , full-size lockers for all
staff members) and that there will be no scheduling
conflicts when using the spaceFor more
information on these issues, see,
“Administration and Public Areas,” and 
, “Staff Areas,” in section 
Food Service
The jail food service area is frequently used as
a lunch and coffee-break space for law enforcement
officersThis sharing of kitchen space has
also emerged where space for disaster services/
emergency operations are included in an overall
facility planIf the kitchen is located outside
the security envelope, this sharing of space is
problematic only to the extent that it tends to discourage
the use of inmate workers in food preparation
and cleanupSecurely moving three meals
a day in and out of the security envelope can be
an inefficient use of staff time 
It is usually better to dedicate kitchen facilities to
jail meal preparation and to locate these spaces
within the jail envelope to enhance security and
to minimize staff time in serving meals and returning
trays and utensilsSeparate canteen or
break area facilities for law enforcement staff outside
of the jail security envelope result in minimal
addition of space and equipment and a more
efficient and secure operation overall 
Deliveries
In older facilities the secure vehicle sallyport
used for delivering arrestees is often used for
deliveries of supplies into the facilityUsing the
arrestee sallyport for other purposes can be dangerous
because of the equipment left in the area,
the potential to introduce contraband into the
secure perimeter, and because it can block secure
delivery of arresteesThe ideal solution is to
provide a separate loading dock for the delivery
of food and suppliesAdditionally, the vehicle
sallyport should not be used for other functions
not related to the processing of arrestees, such
as vehicle maintenance or equipment or supply
storage 
Courts Interface
Although the jail’s interface with the courts varies
by jurisdiction and state law, many of the
arrestees booked into the typical jail will make
one or more court appearances before they are
released from custodyIf inmates are remanded
into custody or cannot make bail, they are often
taken to court many times during their incarceration
for their trial and other court proceedings 
Inmate movement to and from court tends to
occur in three ways:
 The inmate is walked through secure and/or
nonsecure corridors directly to the courtroom 
 The inmate is either driven or walked to a
courtroom at a separate location 

 :
 The inmate appears in court facilities specially
set up at the jail 
Corridor Movements
When the jail and the courthouse are directly connected,
the following considerations should be
taken into account during the planning process:
 Movement through the jail security envelope
should be through an interlocked security
vestibule 
 Once out of the security envelope, as much
movement as possible should be through
corridors, stairs, and elevators to which the
public has no access or where public access
can be temporarily precludedMoving inmates
through the public corridors of the courthouse
is highly undesirable 
 Movement should also be monitored by jail
staff other than the escort officer, such as the
master control officer 
Movement to Offsite Court
Increasingly, new jails are being built on sites
other than the courthouse siteWhen the jail
is on a separate site, court attendance requires
movement of inmates outdoors, thus introducing
increased risks of escape and assaultEven if
the jail is only one block from the courthouse, it
is strongly recommended that an inmate not be
walked to the courthouse, but driven there in a
secure vehicleWhen planning for the movement
of inmates to court, other related considerations
include the following:
 Departure from the jail should be through the
vehicle sallyport 
 Access to the sallyport should, if possible, be
via a secure route that does not go through the
intake/booking area 
 Necessary restraint equipment should be readily
accessible near the vehicle sallyport 
 A place to hold or stage the inmates to be
transported should be available 
 The courthouse should have its own vehicle
sallyport to avoid the need for any inmate
exposure to the public 
Appearances at the Jail
Some jurisdictions with separate jail and court
facilities conduct early, uncomplicated court appearances
at the jailSuch appearances include
arraignments (also called first appearances) and,
in some states, probable cause hearings that are
required before arrestees can be bookedEven
preliminary hearings are conducted at some jails 
These early proceedings can be done at the jail
because they are brief ( –minutes for arraignments)
and do not involve many peopleA very
high percentage of inmates are released on bail,
recognizance, or a third-party signature immediately
or shortly after their first court appearance 
Court appearances at the jail generally take place
in two ways:
 All participants are brought to a specially built
court space or an easily adaptable multipurpose
space at the jail 
 A video appearance system allows everyone
but the inmate, and perhaps a public observer,
to participate from the courthouse 
Courtrooms at the jail
Building a courtroom or multiple courtrooms into
a jail is an option that is not taken very often, especially
in smaller jailsIt is frequently perceived
as inconvenient to judges and court officials, it
adds to construction costs, and it broadens security
responsibilities at the jailWhen this concept
is pursued, several questions must be answered:
 Do jail staff have security responsibilities in
the courtroom, or do the court and its bailiffs?

C h a p t e r :
C r i m i n a l J u s t i c e I n t e r f a c e
 Will all noninmate participants be screened
through jail facility security, including metal
detectors?
 Will defendants who are not in custody
also make their first appearance at the jail
courtroom?
 How extensive will the court operation be?
Must there be space for a judge’s office, a
clerk’s office, attorney-client consultation,
public waiting?
 In smaller jails, can the court space be used
by the jail for program activities in the evening
and on weekends?
Following are some design considerations
that apply if a courtroom is designed into a
jail facility:
 Separate interlocked security vestibules for
access to the courtroom by ( ) inmates and
( ) the public and officials 
 Closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring
and intercom communications to the master
control center 
 A primary security zone for the court area
(e g , window openings constructed of
detention-grade materials) 
Video appearances at the jail
Using video technologies has become the common
way to hold initial court appearances at
many jails, especially when the jail is remote
from the courthouseWith video, the only participants
at the jail are typically the inmate and
jail security staffIn some states, public observers
may have the right to directly witness the
inmate’s court appearance at the jailJudges,
prosecuting attorneys, court reporters, clerks,
bailiffs, and defense attorneys stay at the courthouse 
So do most, if not all, of the public and all
out-of-custody defendants 
Space requirements for video appearances are
minimal and can easily be provided at most jails
in a multipurpose roomEquipment needs are
generally limited to a television (TV) monitor,
a camera, a microphone, switching equipment,
chairs, and a table or podiumVideo signals are
transmitted via microwave, cable TV lines, or
by dedicated wiring if the courtroom is close
enoughMonitors generally provide “split-screen”
views so that all major participants can be seen
at one time 
In developing a video appearance capability
at the jail, several design issues should be
addressed:
 Provision of backup observation of the space
by CCTV or, preferably, direct line of sight
from a staff post 
 Protection of video appearance equipment
from tampering or accidental damage if the
space is shared by other functions (e g ,
through means such as closeable cabinets,
roll-away carts, or closeable alcoves) 
 Configuration of the space so that multiple
inmates can simultaneously hear the initial instructions
from the judge 
 Provision of a fax machine or some other
means by which papers can be moved quickly
between locations 
 Provision of sufficient distance between camera
and defendant to accommodate full-body
views if desired by the judge 
Attorneys
Inmates need access to attorneys, particularly
defense attorneysThis is accomplished primarily
through telephone conversations and personal
meetings or interviews 

 :
Telephones in the dayrooms of housing units
facilitate inmate/attorney consultation but have
the disadvantage of offering limited privacyA
more private telephone alcove or a prefabricated,
acoustically screened station may be a good
solution 
Attorney/client interview space can be either
contact or noncontact, or both, depending on the
standards of individual statesDiscussion with
the local bar association is advised to determine
the best solution in terms of appropriate access
and security 
Attorney access to contact interview spaces
should always be gained by passing through
metal detectors and an interlocked security
vestibuleJurisdictions considering the use of
noncontact visiting space should remember that
attorneys sometimes must pass paperwork to the
inmate for review or signatureWithout a secure
paper pass, jail officers will bear the burden of
passing paperwork back and forth 
When planning for attorney and other professional
visiting areas, the jurisdiction should consider
the following issues:
 Good acoustic quality 
 Ample desk surface for files and paperwork 
 Adequate artificial lighting on the desk surface 
 Seating for at least two attorneys 
 Accessible space compliant with the provisions
of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
for attorneys or inmates who are wheelchairbound
or have other disabilities such as hearing
or sight issues 
 A means of communication that allows attorneys
to talk to staff (e g , to announce the end
of a visit) 
 A panic alarm, in case of an emergency, especially
if the space is not directly observed by a
staff member 
 Locating the space so that random or constant
staff observation is possible 
Public Defenders
The needs of public defenders are somewhat different
from those of private attorneysIt is not
unusual, for example, for the public defender
to see several inmates during one trip to the jail
or, in smaller jails, to represent most of the jail’s
populationFor efficiency’s sake, it is helpful to
design an inmate waiting area adjacent to the
attorney-client visiting rooms (exhibit)Since
such a space could hold a mix of inmate classifications,
it should be in direct view of a constantly
staffed post, if possible 
Another way to make the public defender’s work
more efficient would be to provide a small office
with access to a telephone, computer, and fax
machineThe computer should be linked to any
court or relevant, nonprivate inmate data systems
available

provided for attorney/inmate interviews is normally
sufficient for their needsThe planner must
ensure, however, that enough space is available
to meet the needs of all who will share the space 
The most distinctive need of probation/parole
officers is for hearing spaceProbation/parole
hearings occur when offenders are arrested for alleged
violation of probation or parole conditions 
Many jurisdictions accommodate hearings at the
jail to minimize inmate movement outside the
facilityHearing rooms should accommodate four
to eight people, provide a large table and chairs,
have good acoustics, and provide convenient
electrical outlets for recording and transcription
equipment 

There are important points of interface between
the jail and other components of the criminal justice
systemAlthough the collective space needs
or space organization demands of these other
functions are not great, they have significant impact
on the successful operation of the jailThese
interface issues deserve serious consideration
during predesign planning and skillful development
during design 

C h a p t e r
Functional Components and Relationships
Ajail is a single building made up of many
small pieces, or components, that represent
different functions or activitiesTogether,
the components are intended to satisfy all
of the needs of inmates, staff, and public users of
the jail 
The selection of appropriate components, the
details of their development, and their arrangement
in relation to each other on a selected
site are what make each jail design unique and
responsive to local conditionsIt is this uniqueness
of need and condition that makes it difficult
to apply one standard, “cookie-cutter” design to
all jail design problemsDeveloping a working
knowledge of the various components needed by
the jurisdiction in terms of their function, interrelationship,
and impact on design is critical to
meeting local jail needs effectively 
In response to the need for information on jail
components, the purpose of thisis
twofold:
 To identify the major and typical components
of a jail 
 To describe how these components typically
interrelate 
Detailed functional and design information about
individual components is presented in section,
along with elaboration on many of the issues
raised in this section 
An additional purpose of thisis to review
how certain types of functions might occur in the
same room or area, that is, to identify jail functions
that can share spaceThis is an important
concept for smaller jails in particular, because
the infrequency of certain activities sometimes
makes sharing space essential to the efficient use
of scarce local resources 
Jail Components
If a person documented every possible activity
that could occur in a jail, the resulting list would
be quite lengthyFortunately, not all of these
activities have space implicationsMany are comfortably
managed within major activity categories
for which proper space is designed and allocated,
and some have no direct space impact at all (e g ,
key control and inspections)Following are the
major activity categories, or functional components,
for which dedicated space is needed:
 Master control: Monitors and controls all
building communications, safety and security
systems, entrance and egress routes, and
movement within the facility and often coordinates
management of emergencies in the early
stages 
 Intake-release (also referred to as “booking,”
“reception,” and “admissions”): Receives and
processes incoming arrestees or inmates and
releases outgoing inmates 
 Housing—general: Accommodates the individual
security, sleeping, hygiene, privacy, and
routine personal needs of the main, or general,
inmate population of adult men and women 
 Housing—special: Accommodates the individual
security, sleeping, hygiene, privacy, and
unique care needs of special inmate groups
(e g , those in disciplinary detention or protective
custody; those who have disabilities
or who are mentally ill, suicidal, intoxicated,
or medically infirm; juveniles remanded as
adults) and of inmates who regularly leave
and return to the jail on a regular basis (work
release or periodic confinement) 
 Health care: Accommodates the health care
needs of inmates, including medical and

 :
dental exams, tests, distribution of medications,
sick call, medical records, and storage 
 Visiting: Accommodates individual and
group contact between inmates and family or
official visitors (staff, counselors, attorneys,
etc ) 
 Indoor and/or outdoor exercise: Accommodates
the physical exercise needs of inmates
in an indoor or outdoor setting and storage of
necessary support equipment 
 Programs/services: Accommodates inmate
needs in areas such as recreation, education,
counseling, training, library services, and religious
services 
 Commissary: Accommodates basic inmate
needs or wants for miscellaneous items such
as pens, paper, toiletries, and snacks 
 Food service: Accommodates the receipt and
storage of food and food supplies; the preparation,
delivery, and consumption of meals;
cleanup after food preparation and meals; and
removal of refuse 
 Laundry: Receives, cleans, mends, stores, and
distributes all reusable personal items used in
the facility, such as clothing, linens, bedding,
pillows, and mattresses 
 Administration/public area: Organizes and
manages the daily business of the facility, accommodates
public access to the facility, and
responds to the public’s need for information
and services 
 Staff: Accommodates the training, hygiene, fitness,
and personal needs of facility staff 
 Storage: Accommodates the need to maintain
various types of supplies, equipment, and
spare parts safely and securely 
 Maintenance: Initiates preventive maintenance,
fixes and replaces worn or damaged
equipment and materials, and cleans and
maintains existing facilities 
 Mechanical services: Provides heat, ventilation,
and air conditioning; water and waste
lines; and main and emergency power
supplies 
Degrees of Development
The typical jail has each of the preceding functional
componentsHowever, there are significant
variations from facility to facility in the degree
to which some of these functions are provided,
largely because of operational and economic considerations 
In some facilities, the functions are
minimally developedAs a result, the function
has a limited impact on space and equipment
requirementsIn other facilities, the same components
are fully developed and require a complete
range of space and equipment 
Local officials, planners, and architects must
determine needs with respect to each functional
component during predesign planning to
design and arrange spaces properly 
Some of the functional components that vary
greatly in their degree of development in jails are
discussed belowThese components reveal significant
opportunities for space savings and measurably
affect the way in which a facility operates
on a daily basisThey are discussed further in
sectionIn larger jails there is generally less
flexibility in the development of these spaces 
Food Service
Larger jails will need adequate space and equipment
for food serviceAn industrial food service
operation will require space for cooking equipment
(e g , grills, steam kettles); refrigeration
units; freezers; dry food storage; food preparation
areas; a meal distribution system; a cleanup area,

C h a p t e r :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s a n d R e l a t i o n s h i p s
to include commercial dishwashing equipment;
storage for trays, cups, and utensils; and a food
cart sanitation areaDeveloping space requirements
for a food preparation and distribution
area is complex and will generally require input
from a food service expert 
Due to the expense involved in building
and running a food service operation
in the jail, some smaller jails
have found contracting with local restaurants,
hospitals, or schools to cater
food to be more economical than preparing their
own meals (exhibit )This approach can significantly
reduce space and equipment needs for
food service preparation, storage, and cleanup 
Other facilities choose to serve a cold breakfast
and cater the remaining meals, reducing space
needs compared with a full-service kitchen
operation 
However, with the elimination or limitation of
food service space and equipment, new operational
and design concerns arise:



E x h i b i t Catered Food Service
Jail Food
School
kitchen
Ensuring secure delivery of meals each day,
including dealing with nonjail personnel in the
delivery process 
Maintaining the temperature and quality of
food, which may require equipment and space
for reheating or cooling meal items at the jail 
Distributing the food and, perhaps, providing
space for food distribution equipment, storage,
and cleanup 
 Identifying the source of trays, cups, and utensils
and, if the jail is the source, how and
where they are accounted for, cleaned, and
stored 
Allowing for the possibility of losing catering
services 
Planning for increases in the inmate population
to a point where it is no longer cost effective
to have meals catered 


Laundry Service
Most jails design new facilities with areas for
laundry and storing of clothing and linens used
in the facilityThese laundry areas usually contain
industrial washers and dryers; space for
sorting and folding clothing and other items; storage
areas to hold supplemental clothing, linens,
pillows, and mattresses; and areas for laundry
collection and distribution cartsIt is a common
practice to have work release inmates do their
own laundry at the jail, and washers and dryers
are often installed in the work release housing
area 
However, some jails have found it economical
to use outside laundry services, thus reducing
facility space and equipment needsOthers send
some laundry out (sheets, blankets, jail clothing)
and wash personal underwear, socks, and nonjail
clothing in house 
Even if laundry services are provided by outside
sources, several operational and design issues
remain:
 Ensuring of secure delivery of laundered goods
by nonjail personnel 
 Storing and sorting of laundered goods, including
personal clothing, before distribution 
 Storing goods that are not immediately
distributed 

 :
 Storing carts or other devices used in the pickup
and distribution of laundered goods (usually
a twice weekly clothing/linen exchange) 
 Laundering at the facility selected items (such
as clothing soiled during arrest) required
before the next cleaning cycle because of
imminent court appearance or release 
 Cleaning of nonlaunderable items such as
mattresses 
 Allowing for the loss of contractual services 
Component Relationships
Although each functional component plays a
role in the facility and is generally expressed as a
distinct, consolidated group of subsidiary spaces,
no component operates in a vacuumThe components
serve the same body of users and are
therefore interrelated to some degreeThis interrelationship
may require that certain components
be next to each other, that some merely be close
to each other, or that some be separated from
each otherIt may require the ability to see, hear,
or communicate with another spaceUnderstanding
these interrelationships is critical to organizing
a jail design efficiently and effectively 
Exhibits -and -identify the typical interrelationships
between all of the functional components
that might be assembled in a jailThese
relationships will probably prove satisfactory
for most jails, but it must be stressed that each
jurisdiction must set its own criteria for these
relationships and that there is plenty of room for
variation, no matter how minorMore detailed
information on functional components is given in
section 
Relationship Matrix
One way to express component relationships is
through a matrixThis technique uses symbols
or, as in exhibit , numbers to indicate the nature
of a relationshipBy reading along the boxes
leading from two different components to where
they converge, one can find the number describing
the relationship between the two spacesA
matrix is an effective form of documentation, in
that it is very complete and can be as precise as
desiredThe weakness of a matrix seems to be
that many people find the format difficult to
follow 
Relationship Diagram
To some, a more effective way to communicate
relationships is through use of a relationship diagram
(exhibit )This is normally a drawing
that consists of simple shapes arranged to reflect
the relationship of one component to another 
That is, if two components need to be adjacent,
they are drawn adjacent to each otherIf they need
to be nearby, they are drawn nearby and linked by
a line or graphic connector of some sort 
The component shapes in a relationship diagram
are frequently drawn loosely enough that they
are commonly referred to as “bubbles ” Hence
the phrase, “bubble diagram ”
Relationship diagrams are used more frequently
than matrixes because they can communicate a
greater variety of information, such as view connections
and external relations or public view
conflicts and delivery service access 
Critical Relationships
A series of relationships and nonrelationships
seems to be especially critical in a jailSome of
these involve subcomponents of the jail and deserve
special attention: work release and other
inmate areas; female housing and male housing;
control positions and inmate-occupied areas; arrestee
access, intake-release, and control; public
lobby, visiting, and inmate areas; and maintenance
support spaces and inmate housing areas

Work release and other inmate areas
Since work release inmates come and go from the
jail on a daily basis, there is a high potential for
contraband passage between them and the rest
of the inmate populationConsequently, work
releasees must be kept distinctly separate from
the rest of the inmate-occupied areas of the jail 
Each area shared with non-work-release inmates
provides the opportunity for hiding of contraband
by work releasees for later retrieval by non-workrelease
inmatesContraband may also be passed
to inmate workers during delivery of meals to
the work release area or be hidden on meal trays
and carts to be taken to other inmates in the jail
populationTo be effective, separation of work
releasees should include separate entrances,
laundry facilities, and exercise areasIn larger
jails, inmates sentenced to work release are often
housed in separate buildingsTheir area, as noted
in exhibit , is actually outside the secure
perimeter of the jail

Female housing and male housing
Female housing areas should be physically, visually,
and acoustically separate from male housing
areasThis requires careful design when the
areas are nearby or placed in completely different
locations within the building 
Control positions and inmate-occupied areas
To assure the safety and security of inmates and
staff and to reduce vandalism to the facility in
remote surveillance facilities, staff posts—
potentially including master control—should
be located with a direct view of inmate-occupied
areas (housing, visiting, booking, exercise, and
so forth)Constant direct view allows for better
control of inmate behavior and reduces incidents
that typically occur with intermittent observation,
such as vandalism, assaults, and graffiti
Arrestee access, intake-release, and control
This set of relationships is critical because
of the volume of incoming traffic
at booking, the tension and risks
involved in the booking process, the
presence of officers from other jurisdictions,
and traffic associated with the release
processIf space allows it is ideal to separate the
booking and release functions so that arrestees

C h a p t e r :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s a n d R e l a t i o n s h i p s
are released from a different door than they enter 
Often, in smaller jails master control will be
situated in a place where they can observe the
area and quickly summon assistance in case of
trouble, thereby providing backup for the booking
officer 
Public lobby, visiting, and inmate areas
Control of public access to the secure areas of the
facility is important in any jailBecause visiting
is by far the most common reason for the public
to enter the jail, visiting areas should be located
adjacent to the lobby in a way that allows visitors
to enter a controlled area but never to penetrate
the inmate-occupied zones of the facility, including
corridors(See , “Security Perimeter ”)
If a courtroom is to be associated with
the jail, it too should be located adjacent to the
public lobby 
Maintenance support spaces and inmate
housing areas
To facilitate daily cleaning, maintenance support
spaces, such as janitor closets, need to be located
inside or in close proximity to each inmate housing
areaStaff must be able to provide inmates
cleaning supplies and equipment quickly and
efficiently so that inmates can clean their cells
and dayroom spaces 
Space-Sharing Possibilities
Some functions occur infrequently and could
well take place in the same space at different
times, especially in smaller facilitiesThis flexibility,
if accommodated by proper design, can save
money in facility construction 
Space-sharing possibilities should be examined
during predesign planning and should be judged
on the basis of solid functional programming
information, namely, function, activity type,
scheduling, security, and numbers and types of
usersIf space sharing still seems a possibility
after such an evaluation, the varying architectural
requirements should be examined to assure
construction compatibilitySome of the functions
in which space-sharing possibilities can be found
are special housing, indoor programs and services,
general housing in the smaller jail, contact
visiting/counseling, and indoor/outdoor
recreation 
Special Housing
Compatibility concept: A common space or spaces
could be used interchangeably for short-term
holding of intoxicated individuals, individuals
with mental illness, or temporarily out-of-control
inmatesGiven that smaller jails, in particular, often
will not receive mentally ill and out-of-control
inmates at the same time, and that intoxicated
people tend to be received at specific times during
the week, it would seem wasteful to create a
bank of cells for each of these categories 
Architectural compatibility issues:
 Spartan space with minimum equipment and
protrusions 
 Benches low to the floor (inches) 
 Security toilet/sink fixture 
 Floor drain (possibly flushing) 
 High ceilings 
 Location observable from a staff post or frequently
passed by staff 
 Space that accommodates personnel and/or
crisis intervention workers 
 Sound control 
 Special ventilation 
 Washable surfaces 
 Variable lighting 
 
 :
 Temporary housing only 
 No particular requirement for natural light 
 Protection of the inmate from self-injury by
incorporating rounded edges, padding (if feasible
by code, fire safety, and durability considerations),
protective clothing for the inmate,
and so forth 
Indoor Programs and Services
Compatibility concept: A variety of programs and
services for inmates occur on a regular basis in
most jailsPlanning might determine that most, if
not all programs and services can occur in one or
more multipurpose spaces, depending on scheduling,
the nature of the services, and the number
and type of users: Smaller program rooms can
be located in the housing area to cut down on
inmate movement and can be used for a variety
of activities, such as meetings or counseling sessions,
barbering, classification interviews, and
so forthLarger multipurpose rooms outside the
housing area can be used for educational classes,
meetings, and religious services 
Architectural compatibility issues:
 Acoustical compatibility of various activities
with adjoining areas 
 Size adequate to accommodate the most
space-consuming activity planned for the area 
 Flexibility in furnishings and equipment 
 Storage for alternative furnishings and
equipment 
 Temperature and light control 
 Finishes compatible with each function 
 Ability to clearly observe the space(s) 
 Lack of security conflicts 
General Housing in the Smaller Jail
Compatibility concept: Given that the
nature of the population in a smaller
jail can change rapidly, it makes
sense to create at least one small
housing area that can accommodate
a variety of inmate typesSpecifically, one or
more areas could be designed in such a way as
to accommodate either highor low-security men
or womenSuch a housing area is sometimes referred
to as a “flex” or “swing area ”
Architectural compatibility issues:
 Small capacity unit(s) 
 Ability to clearly observe the space from a
fixed post 
 Appropriately separated from other housing
units 
 Higher security detailing for flexibility (lowsecurity
inmates held in the area could be
provided less-restrictive custody through management
options) 
Contact Visiting/Counseling
Compatibility concept: Attorney contact visiting,
family contact visiting, and counseling all share
a need for privacy, small groups, and interaction
with the publicDuring the predesign programming
phase, each jurisdiction will make decisions
on how it will accommodate contact visits,
who will be allowed to have contact visits, when
contact visits will occur, and how they will be
monitoredEven agencies that minimize contact
visiting must, at the least, provide space for attorneys,
clergy members, and representatives from
other government agencies (e g , social services,
law enforcement, probation, parole, or Immigration
and Customs EnforcementLarger facilities
often have several meeting rooms within a larger
space designated for contact visits and staff dedicated
to monitoring the contact visiting areaThe
 
C h a p t e r :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s a n d R e l a t i o n s h i p s
frequency of these activities in smaller jails suggests
that one common space or set of spaces can
be used, rather than providing separate physical
accommodations for each activityAttorneys and
other potential contact visitors should be consulted
during programming to identify their space needs 
Architectural compatibility issues:
 Private space 
 Small-scale space 
 Location in zone between public areas and
main inmate-occupied areas 
 Ability to clearly observe the space 
Indoor/Outdoor Recreation
Compatibility concept: Both indoor and outdoor
recreation spaces accommodate the same activities,
such as basketball, handball, and weight lifting 
The only difference is outdoor recreation is
open to the outside—natural light and fresh air 
By creating the ability to close open air access to
the outside, a recreation area can be used as both
indoor and outdoor space (exhibit ) 
E x h i b i t Recreation Area That Can Be
Used for Both Indoor and Outdoor Space

Architectural compatibility issues:
 Adequate size to accommodate basketball and

 Storage for recreational and exercise
equipment 
 Heating, cooling, and lighting when used as
indoor exercise space 
 High ceiling to allow for basketball 
 Ability to clearly observe the space 
 Located in close proximity to inmate housing 
 Sight and sound separation from housing areas
to allow use by both males and females at different
times 
Space-Sharing Problem
A space-sharing problem occurs where a space
used by inmates is also used by the public at other
timesFor example, public access to a multipurpose
space that inmates would also use later for
another program creates the potential for a major
contraband passage problemThe visitor could
bring nonmetallic contraband into the facility, undetected
by the normal metal detector, and hide
it for an inmate to retrieve later during a program
in the multipurpose areaThis problem could be
solved by operational procedure (i e , a thorough
area search after use by the public) or by preventing
space sharing by the two functionsThis type
of potential problem should be considered along
with other space-sharing opportunities as each
functional component of the jail is developed 
Conclusion
The space-sharing possibilities and issues discussed
in thismerit consideration 
However, it is important to reiterate that shared
space should be carefully determined only after
predesign planning verifies that function, security
concerns, scheduling needs, and user types make
it feasible 
 
C h a p t e r
Planning and Designing to Standards
Designing a jail involves the application of
codes and standards developed by various
local, state, and/or national agenciesAdherence
to legally mandated codes and standards
requires interaction with officials who represent
the agencies that have established the codes/
standards to obtain the approvals necessary to
initiate constructionAwareness of and adherence
to applicable codes and standards early in
the planning and design process is necessary for
a successful project 
Some people may view codes and standards as
an intrusion into their jail design process and
plansHowever, building codes and standards
exist to preserve the health, safety, and welfare
of building occupantsCodes tend to be ideologically
neutral; virtually all of their content is
based on unsatisfactory and sometimes tragic
experiencesStandards generally represent the
collected wisdom of specialists and practitioners
in a particular field 
If approached positively and early in the process,
codes and standards can be useful tools in
establishing safe and proven design parameters 
Personnel from agencies that develop codes and
standards can provide significant assistance to
local officials and designers based on their experience
with similar projects in the area and
throughout the stateBoth legally binding and
advisory standards are worth reviewing before
design, and even before programming, begins 
Thisidentifies standards and legal requirements
that are referred to throughout the
Jail Design Guide, as well as those that are particularly
relevant to communities involved in the
jail design process 
State Standards
In many states, one or more state government
agencies have legislative authority to promulgate
and enforce minimum jail standardsThese
agencies vary greatly in terms of the resources,
approaches, and legal authorities they employ 
In some states, design and operational standards
for jails are extremely detailed and are strictly enforced;
the responsible authority has the means
to enforce standards up to the point of bringing
suit against local governments whose facilities
are noncompliant or by closing noncompliant
facilitiesIn other states, the responsible agency
may have detailed standards but lack the authority
to enforce them and may therefore be limited
to simply encouraging compliance through educational
strategies such as training and technical
assistance 
In some states, more than one agency has authority
over jail planning, design, and operation 
Often one agency focuses on the planning,
design, and construction requirements while
another agency is primarily charged with establishing
operational requirements that deal with
nonarchitectural aspects such as training standards,
policies and procedures, and inmate services 
Identification and review of state standards
along with an understanding of their official role
in the development of a proposed jail project are
essential 
American Correctional Association
and the Commission on Accreditation
for Corrections
Persons both within and outside the corrections
field may refer to the standards published by the
American Correctional Association (ACA) and
 
 :
the Commission on Accreditation for Corrections
(CAC) as mandated “national standards” or “federal
standards ” However, neither ACA nor CAC
have the authority to mandate or enforce compliance
with their published standards 
ACA and CAC are private, nonprofit organizations
that administer the only national accreditation
program for all components of adult and juvenile
correctionsTheir purpose is to promote improvement
in the management of correctional agencies
and in the design of correctional facilities
through the development and revision of useful
standardsThis effort is supported by the corrections
professionContributions from practitioners
throughout the nation have enhanced these standards 
Agencies that voluntarily decide to participate
in CAC’s formal accreditation program are
required to comply with certain eligibility criteria
and enter into an accreditation contract 
In some states, the state standards affecting jails
are outdated and are limited in their scope and
applicability to modern jailsSeventeen states
have no formal jail standards, and in some states
with jail standards, no specific agency is charged
with the enforcement of those jail statutes or
standardsTherefore, little guidance is available
to local officials and jail staff who are responsible
for the funding and operation of local jailsIn
such cases, the ACA/CAC standards for adult local
detention facilities represent a logical set of
physical plant and operational criteria on which
to base the planning, design, and operation of a
new jail 
ACA/CAC standards pertaining to city and county
jails or local adult detention facilities at the time
of this writing are published as the Performance-
Based Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities,
Fourth EditionA supplement is published
periodically to document additions, revisions,
deletions, and/or interpretations for all ACA/CAC
standards manuals Those who use the ACA/
CAC standards must review both the prevailing
base standards document in its current edition as
well as the most recent supplement 
ACA has recently released a new set of standards
for local adult detention facilities, Core Jail Standards 
In these new standards, the minimum requirements
have been carved out of the broader
professional standards, leaving only those requirements
that apply to every jail, and which
could pose serious liability if compliance was not
maintained 
Whether or not a local community formally
participates in the ACA/CAC accreditation program,
which requires entry into a contract and
payment of an accreditation fee, a jail can use
the Performance-Based Standards for Adult Local
Detention Facilities or the Core Jail Standards to
evaluate its operations and facilitiesAs stated
in the “Introduction to Accreditation” section of
Performance-Based Standards, “The recognized
benefits of such a process may include improved
management; increased accountability and enhanced
public credibility for administrative and
line staff; safer and more humane environment
for personnel and inmates; and the establishment
of measurable criteria for upgrading programs,
personnel, and the physical plant on a continuing
basis ” 
In addition to standards for detention facilities, ACA/CAC publishes standards for most other areas of adult and juvenile
corrections, including prisons, probation and parole, and community residential facilities

National Fire Protection Association
Life Safety Code®
Established in , the National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA) is the leading nonprofit
organization dedicated to protecting lives and
property from the hazards of fireNFPA publishes
hundreds of nationally recognized codes and
standards, including the National Electrical Code
and the Fire Protection Handbook, as well as numerous
fire-service training and fire-safety education
materials 
The NFPA Life Safety Code®is the most authoritative
and widely used resource available to
planners, architects, engineers, building and fire
officials, safety personnel, and manufacturers
whose responsibilities include fire and life safety 
The Code has many provisions that are mandatory
for all types of occupanciesThe term “occupancies”
refers to buildings of different types and
varying usesThe s “New Detention and
Correctional Occupancies” and “Existing Detention
and Correctional Occupancies” are especially
useful to those who are designing a new jail 
NFPA also publishes the Life Safety Code® Handbook,
which includes clarifying commentary and
illustrations to help users understand and apply
Code requirements The Handbook also explains
changes to the Code since the previous edition
was published 
Although NFPA publications and training seminars
are excellent resources, NFPA does not have
the authority to enforce compliance with the
Code or other recommendationsHowever, many
state and local building regulatory agencies have
adopted the Code in whole or in substantial part,
thereby giving its life safety requirements the
force of law in jurisdictions under their purview 
It is important to consult applicable federal, state,
and local laws and regulatory agencies that are
relevant to the planning and design of jailsNFPA
clearly states that it does not endorse compliance
with its Life Safety Code® in cases where Code
requirements are in conflict with other laws with
which a local project must achieve mandatory
compliance

comprehensive civil rights protections to individuals
with disabilities similar to those provided to
persons on the basis of race, sex, national origin,
and religion under the Civil Rights Act of
Title II of ADA is intended to prevent state and
local governments (including entities that operate
jails) from discriminating against persons with
disabilitiesThe law protects detainees in the jail
and others, including staff, program providers,
and visitors 
Although at the time of this writing ADA does
not require retrofitting existing buildings to eliminate
barriers, it does require accessibility for
new constructionUnder Title II, state and local
governments must ensure that newly constructed
buildings are free of architectural barriers that
restrict access or use by individuals with disabilities 
In the case of alterations to existing buildings,
the altered portions must be accessible 
It is important for local agencies to be aware of
the Title II enforcement provision, which states
that private parties and individuals may initiate
lawsuits to enforce their rights under ADA Title
IIIn such cases, local governments may be liable
for damages and plaintiff’s attorney feesIn fact,
in theU SSupreme Court case Lane vs 
Tennessee, the court upheld ADA Title II as well
as its damages provisions 
In addition to private lawsuits, individuals may
also file complaints with eight federal agencies
under Title IIThe U SDepartment of Justice
(DOJ) handles complaints specific to correctional
institutions 
Under the provisions of ADA, DOJ maintains and
enforces technical design standards for compliance
with the actAt the time of this writing,
local governments may choose between two
standards for accessible design: the Uniform Federal
Accessibility Standard (UFAS), established
under the Architectural Barriers Act of , or
the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility
Guidelines (ADAAG), published inand
adopted by DOJ for places of public accommodation
and commercial facilities covered by Title III
of ADA(The elevator exemption for small buildings
under ADAAG would not apply to entities
covered by Title II) 
Neither the UFAS nor ADAAG, as adopted by
DOJ, cover in detail the design standards for
detention facilitiesHowever, since its original
publication, ADAAG has been revised to include
design criteria for public facilities such as detention
facilitiesDOJ has not adopted the revised
guidelines (ADAAG–Interim Final Guidelines);
however, these guidelines provide important design
criteria that should be used in the design of
jail facilities 
Jurisdictions should review UFAS, ADAAG, and
ADAAG–Interim Final Guidelines and follow the
most stringent requirements of eachSuch an
approach would ensure compliance with ADA 
Jurisdictions should also review state and local
accessibility requirements, if there are any 
Between local guidelines and UFAS/ADAAG/
ADAAG–Interim Final Guidelines, the most stringent
requirement will generally prevail 
The following sections provide additional information
about ADA and its impact on jail planning

Location or Dispersion of Accessible Cells
Dispersing accessible cells throughout a facility
ensures that inmates with disabilities can
be housed with other inmates of the same
classification 
 
C h a p t e r :
P l a n n i n g a n d D e s i g n i n g t o S t a n d a r d s
Basic Features of the Accessible Cell
Wheelchair-bound inmates need to be able to
enter their cell, move around inside, and use
the cell’s furnishings without assistanceCareful
planning will incorporate a wider cell door, adequate
clear floor space, and appropriate models
and placement of furniture and plumbing fixtures
(exhibit )The accessible cells should contain
the same features as other cells for inmates
housed at the same classification levelFor
example, if other cells have a writing desk, an
accessible writing desk should be provided in

Common-Use Areas
Common-use areas include locations that serve a
group of detainees, for example, exercise yards,
programming/multipurpose rooms, visiting stations,
dayrooms (including shower areas), and
medical areasA common-use area must be accessible
if it serves an accessible bed or cell or if
it will be used by a detainee who has a disability 
Public and Staff Areas
ADA requirements apply to jail staff and to the
public; therefore, these requirements affect all
areas of a facilityADA covers a wide range of
disabilitiesAlthough the needs of people confined
to wheelchairs receive primary attention
from most designers, other disabilities (such as
hearing and sight impairments) also require attention
when designing a jail facility 
Compliance with ADA is the law for new facilities 
Noncompliance can lead to lawsuits and to
awards of damages to plaintiffsLocal governments
undertaking a jail project must be aware
 
 :
of the latest ADA and other accessibility standards,
guidelines, case law, and other laws, and
should consider hiring consultants, architects,
and/or engineers who are experienced in implementing
the requirements of accessibility laws 
Conclusion
Codes and standards are a significant factor in
the design of a new jailThe latest versions of applicable
codes and standards should be identified
early and applied before design begins (i e , during
the predesign planning stage)Local officials
who are familiar with the codes and standards
should be involved early in the facility development
process 
Special standards developed by national organizations
can serve as an important supplement to
required state or local codesJurisdictions should
take the time to find these standards and apply
them as necessary in the design of a new jail 
 
C h a p t e r
Expansion
Ajail is a large capital expenditure for a
community, so it is paramount that the
facility has a long and useful lifeThe
key to ensuring the jail’s longevity is to plan
for future expansion 
Why Plan for Expansion?
Many communities have the foresight to build
a jail that not only meets their capacity needs
today, but also their projected needs for the next
 toyearsSometimes these projections are
correct, and sometimes they are notDeveloping
bed capacity projections is not entirely precise
because key assumptions that go into formulating
the projections may changeFor example, the
jurisdiction’s population may grow or its crime
rate may increase faster than anticipated
Totally unforeseen factors can also affect the size
of the jail populationRecently, two phenomena—
mandatory sentences and overcrowded state
prison systems—have increased jail populations,
forcing many jurisdictions to build additional
beds they did not think they would needSometimes
the additions are needed within a few years
after a new jail opens 
The failure to develop an expansion plan can
have significant consequences for a community
in terms of public safety and the overall budget 
For example, if a jail does not have the ability
to expand because of design or site constraints,
it could be rendered obsolete because it does
not meet the jurisdiction’s capacity needsIf the
facility is relatively new (e g , less thanyears
old), it may be difficult to persuade taxpayers to
approve funding for a new jailIf that happens,
the jurisdiction may be forced to crowd the jail
beyond its capacity—to the detriment of safety
and security—or board inmates in other jurisdictions
at considerable expense 
Expansion Options
A number of basic options are available to local
jurisdictions as they plan their expansion strategy 
Satellite Jail
Many jurisdictions have built “satellite jails” as
an adjunct to their existing jailTypically, they
have pursued this course because:
 Site constraints do not permit expansion of the
existing jail 
 The existing jail is relatively new and it would
not be prudent (for political and/or fiscal reasons)
to discontinue its use 
 The jurisdiction is interested in developing a
separate treatment or program facility 
The following costs are normally associated with
a satellite jail:
 Site acquisitionPurchasing a new site could
be required if the jurisdiction does not own a
suitable parcel of land 
 Duplicate building componentsSeveral components
of the existing jail (such as exercise
and visiting areas) cannot be shared with the
satellite jail and must be replicated 
 Duplicate staffThe jurisdiction will lose some
staffing efficiency because of the need for
For guidance on estimating future capacity needs, see David MBennett and Donna Lattin, Jail Capacity Planning Guide: A Systems
Approach (Washington, DC: U SDepartment of Justice, National Institute of Corrections, ) 
 
 :
some duplicate staff (such as shift supervisors)
in two facilities 
Double Bunking
Many jurisdictions view double bunking of single
cells as an expansion option because it can increase
capacity quickly and inexpensivelyHowever,
this option has several major drawbacks,
which are discussed at length in, “Single
Versus Multiple Occupancy,” in section 
Planned Additions to the Jail
Constructing additions to the jail (such as new
housing pods) is the preferred expansion option
because it is less expensive and more staff efficient
than building a satellite jailIt is preferred
over double bunking because the fundamental
security and management capabilities of the initial
construction can be maintained 
When To Develop an Expansion Plan
Planning for expansion should begin during the
predesign planning phase and continue through
the development of the facility program because
the expansion plan will affect the jail’s site selection,
design, and operationsIt is important to
realize that the expansion plan will greatly affect
the initial design of the jail because it will tell the
architect how each component will grow and by
how muchThe architect must then arrange and
design the components to allow for that growth 
The expansion plan will assist with site selection
because it will give the architect information
to determine how many square feet are needed
for the building as well as the need for off-street
parking 
The expansion plan should contain the following
information:
 The expansion capacity of the facility
(generally, the jail’s ultimate bed capacity) 
 How each component of the facility should
expand and by how much (in terms of cells,
square feet, equipment needs, or policy
changes) 
 The capacity to increase the amount of
parking spaces 
Setting Expansion Capacity
One method for setting expansion bed capacity is
to use bed capacity projections developed during
the needs assessment step of predesign planning 
If the determination of initial capacity is based
on a projection for the nextyears, it would
be reasonable to use the same data to project a
future expansion capacity for the nextto 
years 
No matter what method or expansion capacity
number is chosen, it is best to project for the addition
of more beds than may actually be needed 
The expansion plan does not mean the jurisdiction
is committed to build additional beds; however,
if additional capacity is ever needed, it can
be accommodated by the building and the site as
specified in the plan 
Vertical Versus Horizontal Expansion
Additions to a jail can be built in two ways—
vertically or horizontally 
Vertical expansion assumes that future construction
will be on top of the existing jailIn the case
of housing, expansion is typically planned to be
built on top of an existing housing pod, with the
new pod having the same basic design and perimeter
wall footprint as the pod belowHorizontal
expansion assumes that future construction
will be adjacent and contiguous to the existing
building 
 
C h a p t e r :
E x p a n s i o n
The major benefit of vertical expansion is that a
smaller site can be used because the expansion
will take place on top of the existing building 
This may be desirable if the jail is to be built on
a small downtown siteHowever, several drawbacks
to the vertical expansion approach should
be considered:
 Potential adverse effects of the initial design
on future expansion 
 Higher initial construction cost 
 Disruption to facility operations 
Potential Adverse Effects of Initial Design on
Future Expansion
If housing expansion is going to be constructed
above an existing housing pod, it is usually assumed
that the future pod will be designed in the
same way as the pod belowThis could, however,
adversely affect the design of the expansion
housing by eliminating design flexibility 
For example, assume that the vertical expansion
plan calls for a dormitory to be built above
an existing dormitory but, because of changing
circumstances, a high-security housing pod with
single cells is needed instead of a dormitoryUnless
there is major renovation to the dormitory,
the high-security housing cannot easily be built
above it, because the locations of interior plumbing
and mechanical chases are not compatible
with high-security housing 
In the same vein, jail standards could change
from the time the jail is built to the time when
expansion is neededNew standards may dictate
different requirements for cell size, dayroom size,
number of showers per inmate, and so forthAs
in the example above, the housing area below
dictates the design of vertical expansion housing
to a great extent 
Horizontal expansion, on the other hand, can
provide flexibilityIt will not be constrained by
an existing building footprint or the plumbing
and mechanical chases of a housing unit below 
Higher Initial Construction Cost
If vertical expansion is to be used, initial construction
costs for the structural elements of the
building will be higher because the structure
(columns, beams, and so forth) must be designed
and built so that it will support the weight of the
future expansion constructionThe initial design
of stairs, elevators, and the mechanical system
must also account for future capacity 
Disruption to Facility Operations
Vertical expansion will likely disrupt facility operations
during construction because construction
workers, tools, and equipment will need
to be inside the security envelopeIf expansion
housing is to be built on top of an existing housing
area, that area may need to be vacated during
constructionThis would be extremely disruptive
because the use of beds in that area could be
eliminated for a long period of time 
Expansion Concept for Each
Component
The expansion plan should not only include an
expanded bed capacity, but also an expansion
concept for every functional component of the
jailThese expansion concepts will tell the designer
how each component will accommodate
future capacity requirements and will, in turn,
begin to dictate design and locationConsiderations
and options for expanding each component
follow 
Master Control
Allowance must be made for future control systems,
touch screens, panels, equipment racks,
 
 :
and stationsIf the control system is computerized,
expansion can be accommodated by adding
control screens to the monitor; this does not
require much (if any) additional spaceIf a hardwire
control system is used, space must be
allocated during initial construction for panels
that will control future locks and intercoms 
Since this component is typically buried in the
core of the building, it is difficult to expand
without major renovation and disruption to operations;
therefore, the system should be sized
initially to accommodate expansion capacity 
Intake-Release
This component should be sized to accommodate
the jail’s expansion capacity because it must be
available continuously for the intake and processing
of arresteesRenovation or expansion of
this area would be extremely disruptive to jail
operations 
Property Storage
Many jails store inmate property in garment bags,
and this component can be expanded in several
waysFirst, the area could be oversized initially
to accommodate additional hanging racks at a
later dateSecond, a tiered hanging rack could
be used; that is, the lower tier could accommodate
the initial capacity and the upper tier
could be used for the expansion capacityThird,
the space could be designed to accommodate a
hanging conveyor system similar to that found at
a dry cleaning businessA conveyor system allows
property bags to be stored more compactly,
which eliminates the need for additional space 
Storage space for bulk property items should also
be sized to allow for expansion 
Health Care
This component could be designed for expansion
capacity or it could be designed for initial capacity
and expanded when the need arisesIf the
latter option is chosen, the health-care component
should be located on an outside wall so that expansion
does not infringe on adjacent components 
Visiting Areas
Visiting areas are typically located in the core
of the jail, which makes physical expansion difficult
or even impossibleThis component can be
expanded without enlarging the physical area by
increasing the visitation scheduleFor example,
expanding visitation from twice a week to four
times a week will allow twice the number of opportunities
for inmates to have visitors 
In direct supervision facilities, visiting rooms
are often located in each housing area, with no
centralized visitation functionThis configuration
allows the number of visiting rooms to be
expanded easily as the facility grows 
Another design consideration, video visitation,
is becoming more common in newer facilities 
With this option the visitor comes to a central
site (either inside the jail or at a remote location)
and visits with the inmate via video cameraIn
most cases, the inmate can access the video visitation
booth in the housing area 
Exercise Areas
This component can be expanded in two ways 
First, the number of hours that the exercise area
is available for use by inmates can be increased 
Second, new exercise areas can be built as part of
housing expansion instead of enlarging existing
exercise areas 
In direct supervision facilities, exercise areas
are often attached to each housing area; as new
housing pods are built, new exercise areas will be
attached 
Programs and Services
The number of hours per week that programs
and services are offered can be increased if the
 
C h a p t e r :
E x p a n s i o n
schedule allowsOtherwise, new space would be
required for expanded programs and services 
Inmate Commissary
Expansion can be accomplished by building a
commissary storage area large enough for a highdensity
storage system at a later date or by locating
the commissary on an exterior wall so that it
can be physically expanded 
Food Service
Extra space can be provided for the addition of
food service equipment when bed capacity is
expanded, or the kitchen can be located on an
outside wall and physically expandedPhysical
expansion of this component, however, can be
difficult because of the precise arrangement of
equipment in specific work areas, including storage
and receiving, food preparation, cooking,
meal tray assembly, and cleanupSpecial mechanical
considerations such as exhaust ventilation,
gas lines, and drain lines also make physical
expansion difficultJurisdictions often choose to
over build the kitchen in anticipation of increases
in the inmate population 
Laundry
The laundry operation can be expanded by
increasing the number of operating hours, by
providing space for additional equipment when
capacity is added, or by locating the laundry
room on an exterior wall and physically expanding
it 
Lobby
The lobby is typically sized to allow for the facility’s
expansion capacity 
Administration Area
The administration area can be sized to accommodate
the maximum number of staff or can
be located on an exterior wall and physically
expandedIt is always a good idea to include extra
square footage or extra offices in the area as
part of the initial construction because additional
administrative staff are often added before jails
reach the point of expansion 
Staff Areas
Locker rooms are typically sized for expansion
capacity and for the maximum number of staff 
However, they could be located on an exterior
wall to permit physical expansion 
Storage Areas
Some storage areas can be added when additional
housing is builtFor example, a new mattress
storage area or linen storage area could be built
as part of new housing expansion so that it can
be located closer to the housing areas it serves 
Another alternative is to use high-density storage
systems at a later date if feasibleSeparate standalone
buildings could be used to provide storage
for areas that do not have security concerns 
Conclusion
It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict how the
needs of a jail may change in the futureJail expansion
concepts that are easy to execute, cause
minimal disruption to existing day-to-day operations,
and permit flexibility in future design will
serve the community for decades to come

Functional Components
This section contains detailed information on the purpose and design of the major
functional components of a jailThis information is organized to provide local officials,
board members, and planners with a sound background in the fundamental
issues, characteristics, and concepts of each major componentThis information
should help local sheriffs, commissioners, and planners create a solid foundation
from which to develop a detailed set of plans that responds to unique local jail
needs

The concepts addressed in section, “Major Design Considerations,” are discussed
throughout the following sThe link between sections and is critical
because, as the following pages show, a design is truly the result of the functional
and operational needs of facility users—needs that are determined during predesign
planning 
 
C h a p t e r
Master Control
The basic function of master control (also
referred to as “central control”) is to serve
as the monitoring and control center for all
communications, life safety and security systems,
and all general building movement patterns,
including entries and exits through the main security
envelope of the jailMaster control may
also function as a point from which some inmate
housing units or other inmate or public areas are
monitoredIn smaller jails, it might also be combined
with the law enforcement dispatch function
and handle public reception during some or
all shiftsIn some very small jails, master control
may serve as the only secure, fixed staff post
within the facility and is truly the “nerve center”
of the operation 
All jails, including very small jails, have traditionally
had some sort of control center, even if
it consisted only of an unprotected control panel
Computerized master control room with two staff stations 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )
in a relatively insecure roomIn smaller jails, the
only reason the control post was staffedhours
a day often was because it also doubled as the
dispatch center for the law enforcement agency
affiliated with the jail 
Key Decisions
The following decisions should be made as the
role of the master control component is evaluated
because decisions made here will have a fundamental
effect on design requirements:
 Will master control only monitor electronic
security and safety systems, or will it have
other responsibilities such as lobby reception,
housing area surveillance, intake-release area
surveillance, record keeping, answering outside
telephone calls, supervising visiting, or
receiving packages? That is, what are master
control’s responsibilities and how many staff
will be needed to do the job?
 Where must the master control space be located
to function effectively in conjunction with
other facility activities and still be adequately
protected from assault?
 Will the master control function be combined
with the law enforcement dispatch function?
Can both jobs be done by one person throughout
the life of the facility? Are both functions
compatible in terms of security, since the loss
of master control to an inmate takeover would
also mean the loss of all law enforcement
communications?
Detail Issues
The details of the functional-architectural issues
discussed below should be considered in the development
of the master control component 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Users
Issue: Use of the master control center should
be principally limited to master control staff 
Response: The need for security in master
control clearly precludes access to the space
by inmates or the public, but access by jail
staff should also be limitedRoutine communications
and contact between master
control and other officers should be accomplished
through means such as intercoms,
radio communication, and passthroughs
rather than by entry into master control 
Master control should not serve as the focal
point for staff breaks or periods of inactivity,
as it does in many facilities 
Activities
Issue: Master control functions must be identified
and priorities set in terms of tasks and
workload responsibilities 
Response: Experience with newer jails has
shown that it is easy to overburden this vital
positionFacilities with as few asbeds
can have noticeable difficulty using a single
master control position effectively for many
jail functions when master control is also
responsible for law enforcement dispatch
functions 
Examples of master control jail functions:
 Monitoring electronic surveillance systems
(audio, closed-circuit television (CCTV)) 
 Controlling entries to and exits from the secure
perimeter of the facility 
 Monitoring various building systems (radio,
surveillance alarms, perimeter lighting, and
other mechanical and electrical systems) 
 Monitoring and facilitating all internal staff
and inmate movement 
Combined law enforcement dispatch and jail master control functions,
with one staff member 
(Photograph courtesy of Jim Rowenhorst )
 Serving as the communications center for the
facility, including receiving and/or handling
telephone calls 
 Maintaining and monitoring necessary
security/safety equipment, such as fire alarms,
smoke and thermal detection systems, selfcontained
breathing apparatus, key lockbox,
flashlights, and storage for riot gear (e g , batons
and restraints) 
 Monitoring and assuming final responsibility
for inmate counts 
 Producing and/or managing jail records and
logs 
 Distributing keys, logs, radios, flashlights, and
other equipment to staff 
 Exchanging packages and paperwork with the
public and mail with postal workers and receiving
bail and commissary moneys 
 
C h a p t e r :
M a s t e r C o n t r o l
 Monitoring staff shift changes, including identification
checks and logging of arrivals and
departures 
 Providing surveillance of adjacent housing
units and inmate activity areas 
 Providing surveillance of special temporary
holding areas, such as those for the mentally
ill or intoxicated 
 Providing primary or backup observation and/
or monitoring of:
Public lobby or night vestibule (i e ,
public access) 
Main jail corridors 
Elevators 
Housing units 
Visitors (public, attorneys) 
Vehicle sallyport 
Intake-release area 
Temporary holding cells 
Multipurpose or indoor exercise room 
Outdoor exercise areas 
Storage of bond moneys and legal
documents 
Storage of prescription medicines and
first-aid kits 
Examples of master control law enforcementrelated
functions:
 Radio dispatching of patrol cars 
 Receiving incoming department telephone
calls 
 Handling of emergency system 
 Dispatching ambulance services 
 Coordinating emergency disaster dispatching 
 Monitoring fire alarms and burglar alarms at
local businesses and institutions 
 Record keeping and computer data entry 
 Managing national, state, and/or local criminal
data systems 
It should be clear that combining the many functions
just described for law enforcement with
those for the jail would create an unmanageable
situation for one person to handle on some or all
shiftsHowever, with staff at a premium, good
planning should attempt to get the most from the
master control post without sacrificing facility
security and staff and public safety 
A full evaluation of the workload of master control
is warranted prior to the design phaseSuch
an evaluation should take into account future
change and workloads because master control
may require two people rather than one on certain
shiftsFor smaller systems that combine
the functions of master control and dispatch, be
aware that all control of the jail and all security
and communication links within the county may
be severed if the space is overtaken by inmates 
Security
Issue: Master control should be able to control
the entire facility if necessary 
Response: In the event of a disturbance,
a fire emergency, or an equipment breakdown,
master control should be able to
secure and control the facilityFor example,
if there is a second housing control post by
which other staff supervise or manage a
housing area, master control should have
the operational capability to override those
controls if need be 
In fulfilling the backup role, master control may
need to release multiple cells simultaneously,
remotely open housing unit dayroom doors, and
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
allow egress of inmates to a safe holding area 
As a primary function, master control must be
able to remotely allow entrance of emergency
personnel into all areas of the buildingMaster
control should also maintain a master set of jail
keys for manual override of locking mechanisms
in case of a power loss (although emergency
power generation should be a feature of all jail
designs) 
Issue: The construction of the master control
area must be fundamentally secure to preclude
access by inmates and the public 
Response: Because master control is the
“nerve center” of the jail and may also contain
the law enforcement communication
center, the creation of a physically secure
space is vitalA secure envelope must be
created for master control; that is, the walls,
floor, and ceiling of master control must be
constructed of secure materials 
A secure ceiling is particularly important because
many buildings have a ceiling plenum (an
area between the ceiling and the roof or floor
above for structural beams, ductwork, electrical
conduit, and so forth)If inmates penetrate the
plenum, they might gain access to master control
through the ceiling unless the ceiling is of secure
construction (e g , concrete, steel decking, or cement
plaster with metal lath)An alternative to
secure ceiling construction is to extend the security
walls of the space up past the ceiling to the
floor or roof construction above 
Selection of the correct security glass product
is also essential to creating a secure envelope 
In selecting detention glass, remember that no
security glass product is impenetrable or shatterproof,
only penetration-resistant and shatterresistant 
Penetration resistance is the primary
need in master control because the glass must at
least delay, if not prevent, unauthorized access 
Shatter resistance is a lesser, though still important,
issueGlazing panels should be as wide as
possible to maximize view without interruption
by normally thick security framingPanel height
should be examined carefully where vertical view
relationships are important 
Issue: All openings into master control must
be secure 
Response: Besides the obvious opening
of the entry door, other critical openings
that must be able to be secured include
passthroughs, air supply openings, and
electrical openings 
Secure entry is often handled by creating a vestibule
into the master control areaThe doors
to the vestibule are normally “interlocked,” that
is, they cannot both be opened at the same time
unless the interlock is purposely overridden (a
capability that should exist)Doors normally
swing inward so the master control officer can
barricade them shut if need be 
A vestibule created solely for access to master
control requires valuable square footage and can
impede views to other areasOne approach in
response to this issue is to allow the vestibule
entry to the secure perimeter (which is frequently
adjacent to and monitored by master control) to
double as the secure entry to master control
(exhibit ) 
Another important issue in a jail in which there
is only one master control officer is to provide a
means of access to master control in case the officer
becomes incapacitatedOne such means is
a key kept in another secured area that is readily
accessible to authorized staff 
Passthrough openings for keys, packages, walkietalkies,
and paperwork serve to prevent the introduction
of such dangerous items as chemical
agents, explosives, or firearmsThese openings

openings for light fixtures and outlets should also
be secured to prevent access 
Issue: All power, communication, and computer
lines outside the master control space must be
secured 
Response: It would do little good to secure
the master control space if the sources of
its power and capabilities were vulnerable 
Consequently, the electrical, mechanical,
and emergency power sources for the facility
must be protectedIf control center
computers are housed in a room outside
the master control area, they must also be
secure 
Electrical panels that contain relays, switches,
and wiring for control systems must also be protected,
as must the electrical lines carrying power
between master control and the locks, intercoms,
and monitoring systems under its control 
View
Issue: When master control is required to provide
monitoring in specific areas, the design
should allow for effective visual observation of
those areas 
Response: If master control is to provide
backup or principal monitoring of an area,
a direct line of sight to that area should be
created wherever possible in lieu of reliance
on CCTV monitoringDirect visual observation
is more effective and has the secondary
benefit of letting inmates know they are under
observation 
A difficulty with the master control position
providing direct visual observation of various
activities arises if master control is expected
to observe too many thingsWhen this occurs,
master control can become an overly large and
unwieldy space in order to be next to, or in view
of, everything (exhibit )As the planning
team increases the responsibilities of the master
control position and the control space gets larger,
they must determine the precise location of the
master control staff and equipmentThe desired
view and the proximity of master control to different
spaces may not be attained when the

actual location of the staff position is established 
Unanticipated blind spots or excessive movement
away from the control panel may compromise
staff’s ability to view key areas 
Issue: Views into and through master control
should be controlled 
Response: When master control becomes
the hub of a series of adjacent activities that
it monitors, the prospect of view conflicts
between spaces arisesInmates may see
through master control to public areas, be
able to view control boards and computer
screens in master control, or be able to view
or communicate with inmates of the opposite
sex in other areas 
Several approaches can be taken to prevent these
problems:
 Minimize the potential for view conflicts by
minimizing the number of areas that master
control must directly observe 
 Use equipment or partitions in master control
to screen views 
 Raise the floor height of master control to
help limit views into the control room (exhibit
)With this technique, it is important to
ensure that the control platform is not so high
that it eliminates a line of sight between the
master control officer and the floor officer or
between the master control officer and inmates
in adjacent areasThe capability for convenient
communication between master control
and roving staff and the ability to pass logs,
keys, and other items between them should be
preservedIn establishing proper floor height
and sightlines, be sure to factor in the location
and height of control panels and television
monitors 
 Selectively apply reflective, one-way, or tinted
glass to the master control area or to the inside
of the rooms from which view conflicts arise 
However, such glass severely limits contact
and interaction between master control and
inmates, the public, and other staffTinting or
mirroring also affects the intensity of lighting
required in adjacent spaces monitored by master
controlIf tinting is not uniformly applied
to all master control glass panels, internal light
reflections off the glass can erode view quality 
Another critical view conflict often arises in
smaller jails when dispatchers operate master
control and become uncomfortable being visible
to inmatesTheir response is often to screen
themselves from view, thus defeating the location
and design of master controlThe solution may
lie in the selection and training of staff rather
than in the designSee , “Criminal Justice
Interface,” in section 
Design Efficiency
Issue: Master control must be laid out efficiently 
Response: Control panels and/or touch
screen monitors should be within easy reach
of the officer (exhibit )(Note: The use
of hard-wired control panels is not recommended
in the design of any new facility,
as such panels are not easily changed or
expanded and can be difficult and cumbersome
to use and repair )

Not desirable
Control panels can be organized independently
of each other by function (locks, lights, intercom)
or together on one panel by the physical location
in the building to which the functions correspond
(that is, locks, light, intercom grouped together
by space—e g , dayroom, cell)Touch screens can
be customized by area using separate screens on
a single monitor
Grouping frequently used controls by the location
to which they correspond is more efficient,
although it can be more costly and complicated
to install and can result in very large panels if a
hard-wired system is used rather than a computerized
touch-screen system 
It is important to the design to determine whether
the staff assigned to master control will sit or
standIf the nature of the post requires frequent
movement around the space, standing or sitting
on a high stool might be preferred over a low
seatThis decision must be coordinated with
decisions regarding the design of the master control
area and of the sill and head heights of glass
view panels in the walls 
If control staff are constantly leaving their equipment
and moving around the master control
space to do all the jobs required and to obtain
all the necessary views, the master control task
may become quite frustrating and inefficientReducing
control functions and switching duties to
other staff might be a better solution 
Ready accessibility to such things as life safety
annunciator panels, bulletin boards, inmate location
charts, post orders, and egress plans frequently
demands that some solid wall space be
provided in master controlThus, it is difficult
to provide a totally efficient, fully glazed space 
This may be beneficial, though, because it can be
overly stressful to work in what some refer to as
a “fish-bowl” environment 
Environment
Issue: The master control environment should
reduce stress and fatigue and enhance control
activities 
Response: Sound-absorbing materials such
as carpet and acoustic ceiling tile can reduce
sound reverberation (echoes) and the
harshness of sound that could easily result
from the incessant noise of master control
equipment 
Temperature and ventilation are critical considerations
because the equipment within master
control frequently generates excessive heatTo
alleviate this problem, it would help to make special
or separate provisions to cool and ventilate
the master control space and to give some control
over these conditions to the staffSeparate
provisions also aid security because they make
master control less vulnerable to attack and help
eliminate the transmission of unwanted sound
Hard-wired systems rely on buttons and wires for each lock, camera, intercom, etcTouch-screen systems rely on a computer
monitor with multiple screens and symbols representing functions, with coded signals being sent through a few wires to the lock or
other function involved 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
from inmate-occupied areas that can result from
improperly designed ductwork 
Giving the master control officer the ability to
control the intensity of direct and indirect lighting
can be helpful in minimizing eyestrain by
reducing glare and reflections from monitors and
glazingIt also helps balance light levels between
touch screen monitors, CCTV monitors, panel
lights, adjacent rooms, and the master control
area 
Even though frequent staff breaks are recommended,
master control staff should be able to
get a drink of water and use restroom facilities
without leaving the master control spaceTherefore,
having such facilities accessible from within
master control is very desirableA place for a coffee
pot may also be desirable 
Communication
Issue: Easy communication should be provided
throughout the facility 
Response: Master control should be linked
by telephone or intercom to all key areas of
the facility, including all staff control posts
and work areasA facilitywide public address
system is not appropriate for point-topoint
communication between staff where
privacy or discretion is desired 
Continuous communication with officers not assigned
to a constantly staffed post (rovers) or
with transport officers may require the use of a
portable radio systemAn officer duress system,
tied to alarms at master control, can be incorporated
into the portable radio system to provide
additional officer safetyMaster control should
also have some means by which to communicate
to all housing units and major areas used by inmates
in case other control posts become
inoperative 
Communication between master control and
adjacent spaces always seems to be a special
problem in new jails owing to the use of security
glass, concrete block, and other materials that
effectively form solid walls through which sound
does not transmitIt is advisable to use electronic
devices or secure portals through which direct
voice contact can be establishedIn either case,
the convenience of the users should be taken into
account 
Portals to public areas should be secure; electronic
communications are preferableDirect
two-way visual contact between the control officer
and the public visitor tends to be preferred
by both parties 
Equipment
Issue: The sophisticated electronic control and
communication equipment needed in modern
jails must be accommodated 
Response: Master control has become a very
sophisticated element of the modern jail

C h a p t e r :
M a s t e r C o n t r o l
It tends to rely heavily on computer-based
controls, detection devices, and communications 
With this technology comes the
need to provide adequate secure space for
the equipment needed to facilitate master
control operationsIdeally, this equipment
should be housed in a secure room off the
master control area and within the secure
envelop of the master control area 
Fire Safety
Issue: Proper fire safety provisions are essential
within master control 
Response: Although planners must check
local codes for specific fire safety requirements,
several general considerations for
fire safety in master control should be
noted:
 Master control should use firesuppression
systems that minimize
equipment damage 
A fire extinguisher and self-contained
breathing apparatus (air pack) should
be available in master control 
A direct alarm link to the fire department
should be available in master
control 
Provisions for smoke evacuation or
blocking smoke movement from other
areas into master control should be
considered

Expansion
Issue: The design of master control should consider
and accommodate expansion of the area 
Response: Master control is not easy to
expand because of its nature and generally
central location in the jailTherefore,
if workload demands are likely to increase
to the point where two or more positions
are needed, it would be wise to design
master control as a multiple-position space
from the startSuch a design must account
for appropriate space and arrangement as
well as consider how the extra posts might
split or share functions, thereby requiring
some duplication of equipment and power
sources 
Space List
Some of the typical spaces that might be found
with the master control component include:
 Master control work space 
 Dispatch work space (if combined with master
control in small jails) 
 Restroom 
 Computer/electronic equipment room 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s

Local codes and ADA guidelines regarding accessibility
requirements should be consulted when
planning these spaces

Intake-Release
The intake-release area of a jail—often
referred to as booking, admissions, or
receiving—is an active, vital component
of any jail operation (exhibit )This area is
used for three critical jail functions:
E x h i b i t Intake-Release Area
Intake
In
Out
Release
Inmate
housing
Receiving Admissions
 Conducting all intake activities involved in
initially receiving arrestees from the field or
inmates from court or other facilities:
Secure entry/verification of arresting
authority 
Searches 
Receiving and temporarily storing selected
arrestee property 
Booking, fingerprinting, and photographing
arrestees 
Temporary holding of arrestees 
Interview/visiting space or telephone access
for bonding agents 
Screening/interviewing of arrestees by law
enforcement, parole, probation, or others 
Preliminary medical and suicide screening 
Providing minor first aid 
 Conducting all intake activities involved in admitting
arrestees or processing arrestees before
they are moved to a housing unit:
Exchanging personal clothing, dress-out
into facility-issued clothing 
Shower/decontamination 
Searches 
Storing personal and facility-issued
clothing/property 
Inmate orientation to facility services and
rules 
Indepth health and suicide screening 
Initial inmate classification 
Movement to housing unit 
 Conducting all activities involved in releasing
arrestees or inmates from either the receiving
area or a housing unit:
Verifying identity 
Executing release paperwork 
Exchanging clothing, dress-out 
Returning property 
Providing secure exit 
Many facilities are designed with a separate release
area where inmates turn in facility-issued
items, dress in their personal clothing, receive
other personal items that were in storage, and
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
complete release paperwork without disrupting
the booking operations 
The intake-release area provides the arrestee with
his/her first impression of the facility and sets
the tone for his/her stay, much in the same way
that the jail’s public lobby and reception areas
influence the public’s first impressionArchitecturally
and operationally, the intake-release area
sets the stage for subsequent inmate behavior by
what is communicated verbally and nonverbally
when the arrestee first comes into custody 
The intake-release area is used frequently because
every arrestee or inmate who enters the
facility is in this area at least onceIn addition,
at this point arrestees and inmates can be in
various mental and physical states (e g , angry,
intoxicated, emotionally disturbed)Therefore,
the planning and design of this area require special
care and attentionThe result should be a
set of spaces that allow staff and inmates to
function in a safe, secure, calm, and orderly
way that preserves human dignity to the greatest
extent possible 
Modern jails provide much more space for intake
and release functions than the typical jail of the
pastFew older jails provided secure and protected
vehicle sallyports or temporary holding capabilities;
instead, the inmate waited in the booking
area or was moved directly to a cellblockIn
many older jails, processing arrestees for housing
occurred without a shower or a change of clothes
and without any screening for medical and mental
health problemsBooking areas in older jails
were rarely within a fully secure perimeter and
sometimes were combined with the dispatch
function in an area accessible to the publicOver
the years, litigation forced staff to squeeze many
of these needed but neglected functions into
whatever limited space might be available (e g ,
hallways, storage spaces, or closets)The results
were often far from satisfactory 
Modern intake-release areas tend to provide
space for a full variety of intake-release functions
and to consolidate them into one distinct complex
of interrelated spaces within the jail’s main
security perimeter 
Key Decisions
In evaluating the role of the intake-release component,
the following decisions must be made
because they have a fundamental impact on design
requirements:
 Will officers with arrestees enter the jail
through a secured vehicle sallyport or will they
park in, and move through, unprotected outdoor
areas to gain access to the jail?
Will the arresting officer assist in the receiving
and admitting process or can his/her involvement
be limited to minimize the tension between
the arrestee and officer that results from
an arrest?
Will the arresting officer interview the inmate
at the jail prior to booking to gather information
for completing reports or will this take
place prior to arrival at the facility?
Will arrest procedures (such as administering
a breathalyzer) be conducted at the jail or at
some other location prior to arrival at the jail?
Will the facility accept intoxicated, mentally
ill, or injured persons or can they be taken
directly to alternative facilities? If they are accepted
at the jail, will specially trained staff
and designated areas be made available to accommodate
them?
Will there be a release area separate from the
receiving and admissions area or will release
occur in the same area?
Will inmates housed in the facility wear clothing
provided by the facility or their personal
clothing?






 
C h a p t e r :
I n t a k e R e l e a s e
 Will females be processed in areas separate
from those used for males or does the design,
supervision, and scheduling effectively eliminate
any problems that may result from using
one area?
 Will the booking area be staffed at all times or
will staff only be present when an intake or
release occurs?
 Will inmates waiting for transportation to or
returning from court be staged in the booking
area or another holding area?
Detail Issues
Following is a discussion of the detailed functionalarchitectural
issues to be considered when developing
the intake-release componentBecause the
design of the intake-release area involves many
complex questions, the issues are divided into
four categories: general design, receiving area,
admission area, and release area 
General Design
These issues pertain to the entire intake-release
area: users, location, arrangement, environmental
quality, and security 
Users
Issue: Identify those who will use the intakerelease
area so that the space can be planned
and designed effectively 
Response: Jail staff (including correctional
officers, medical personnel, and support
staff), new arrestees, and law enforcement
officers will use the intake-release area most
frequentlyIntake-release staff must process
all inmates for admission into the facility or
for pretrial release via bail, recognizance,
citation, or third-party releaseLocal law
enforcement officers will use the area to
deliver arrestees for receivingOther law enforcement
officials (e g , federal marshals or
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers)
might use the area for temporary detention
of inmates in transitCourt officers
or transport personnel may use the area for
staging to prepare inmates for transport to
and from court, appointments, or transportation
to other agenciesProbation and parole
officers may use the area to temporarily
hold violators or to interview arrestees who
may be eligible for pretrial release programs 
A variety of arrestees and inmates might use the
receiving area and shape the space needsSome
of the disparate behaviors and characteristics
typically encountered include:
 Scared and unpredictable 
 Violent and angry 
 Nonviolent and passive 
 Career criminals 
 Average citizens 
 Males 
 Females 
 Juveniles charged as an adult 
 Intoxicated on drugs or alcohol 
 Injured 
 Physically or mentally disabled 
 Suicidal 
Others who may use the area intermittently or
frequently include medical and mental health
personnel, bondspersons, attorneys, and pretrial
services personnelBecause they may need work
space in the intake-release area at the same time
that law enforcement and jail staff require space,
the feasibility of all users sharing the same space
or needing several spaces must be considered 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
The size of the receiving area and requirements
for separate spaces and other amenities should
be based on actual historical booking records and
future projections of receiving and admissions
activityIt is critical to recognize that the number
of arrestees or inmates in the intake-release area
at any one time can vary greatly based on the following
factors:
 Unusually busy times (weekend nights or
during transfer to court) 
 Length of stay in temporary holding 
 Group arrests 
In determining the number of users, it is important
to consider that an arrestee’s average length
of stay in the receiving area of a newer jail might
be longer than that in an older jail because most
newer jails provide a holding capability in the
receiving areaThis allows the arrestee to spend
several hours in the intake area while trying to
arrange release or while waiting for others to
make arrangements, rather than being moved to
a housing unit shortly after bookingThe admission
process is completed only after it becomes
apparent that release will not occur in a timely
manner and that the inmate should be moved to
a housing areaAdequate staff supervision must
be provided for arrestees in the intake area

Location
Issue: The location of the intake-release area is
vital to the facility’s efficient operation 
Response: Following are the key criteria for
the location of the intake-release area:
 Within the secure perimeter of
the facility 
 Adjacent to a controlled entrance
to the building such as a
vehicle sallyport or entry vestibule 
In smaller jails, it is often
located within view of master control
because this station will likely control
all access to the building and provide
visual backup for the area 
 Near the public lobby to allow a convenient
and dignified release 
 Near visiting or interview areas to
allow access to friends, family, attorneys,
and bondspersons who are integral
to inmates’ release or who help
with personal matters 
 Near the medical examination area to
allow easy access to these servicesIt
is often convenient to have a medical
examination room in the booking area
so arrestees can easily be screened
prior to moving to a housing area or
receive emergency medical attention if
they need it 
 Near cells used for mentally ill or
intoxicated individuals, if such cells
are not provided in the intake-release
 
C h a p t e r :

areaThese cells should be quickly
accessible from the secure entry to
minimize the difficulty of moving
these individualsIn addition, these
cells should be observable from a post
that is constantly staffed 
 Near the laundry or clothing storage
area, if inmates will change into facilityprovided
clothing prior to entering a
housing unit 
 Near offices of personnel involved in
pretrial screening and near interview
rooms they or others might use 
Exhibit -at the end of thisillustrates
these relationships 
Arrangement
Issue: The arrangement of intake-release
spaces must facilitate inmate and staff flow and
ensure the area’s integrity and functions 
Response: A series of primary flow sequences
occurs in an intake-release areaThey
should be charted in sequence to identify
the types of spaces needed and their fundamental
arrangement 
The different types of flow that may occur in the
intake-release area include:
 Receiving an arrestee 
 Receiving and admitting an inmate transferred
from another facility 
 Readmitting an inmate who temporarily left
the facility 
 Processing an arrestee for housing 
 Releasing an arrestee prior to admission 
 Releasing an inmate after a stay in a housing
unit 
 Releasing an inmate for a court appearance 
It is generally recommended that work release
inmates enter and exit the facility through a separate
access pointHowever, this may be impractical
and unnecessary for a jail that has:
 A very limited capacity 
 A low arrestee receiving and release rate,
which suggests minimal potential conflicts and
a greater ability to concentrate on the management
of contraband problems through staff
and policy 
 A need to use space and equipment in the
intake-release area because duplication cannot
be justified 
However flow is projected to work through the
intake-release area, all spaces in the area should
be consolidated into one distinct group of spaces
that work together and are uninterrupted by other
nearby activities and functionsThat is, pieces
of the intake-release area should not be scattered
throughout the facilityConsolidation allows for
smooth and effective operations and helps retain
the arrestee’s privacy and dignity because, for
many arrestees, contact with the jail can be successfully
limited to the intake-release area alone 
(As many as one-third of all arrestees might be
released within the first hours of stay and twothirds
withinhours )
In this regard, it is important to ensure that there
is proper separation between the spaces involved
with receiving and those involved with processing
arrestees before transfer to a housing unit,
which requires more privacy (e g , shower, dress,
unclothed body search (if applicable))Particular
attention needs to be given to privacy because
both male and female arrestees will likely use
the intake-release area in all but the largest jail
systems 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Environmental quality
Issue: The intake-release environment should
help reduce tensions and create a calm, orderly,
and secure intake process 
Response: Although the creation of a calm,
pleasant, and orderly atmosphere is in
many ways dependent on staff attitudes,
architecture can help considerablySuch an
atmosphere can help reduce initial tensions
and anxieties and thereby reduce the potential
for aggressive behavior by arrestees 
When the appearance and atmosphere of
the intake-release area is normalized it communicates
an expectation of rational behavior
and often produces that result (exhibit
)

Vestibule
The area’s appearance and character—and how
individuals respond to it—can be improved in
a number of ways without sacrificing security 
Possible techniques, which should be used selectively
depending on different types of inmates
and staff considerations, include:
 Using more conventional construction materials,
such as concrete masonry units and security
glass instead of steel plate and bars 
 Using “softer” materials that add warmth to
the area and improve acoustics, including:
Carpet 
Lay-in acoustic ceiling tile 
Durable but more attractive furnishings,
such as plastic and wood, rather than concrete
and metal in waiting areas 
Solid-core wood doors for holding cells for
compliant, nonviolent arrestees 
 Using warm and bright colors rather than institutional
colors and patterns 
 Providing normalizing diversions such as
television and magazines 
 Providing maximum freedom in holding accommodations,
such as open waiting areas for
arrestees who do not require a more restrictive
setting 
 Providing easy access to telephones for arrestees
to use to secure bail or make other
arrangements

C h a p t e r :
I n t a k e R e l e a s e
Overall, the intake-release area should create
an appearance similar to that of a well-designed
waiting area in a clinic; at the same time, the
underlying construction approach, a well-defined
security zone, and staff supervision can enhance
the ability to segregate and restrain disruptive inmates
when needed 
Security
Issue: Because of the sensitive and difficult nature
of intake-release functions, close security
and control are required 
Response: Given the emotional stress and
unpredictable behavior involved in the
receiving process and the potential for
security problems during receiving, admissions,
court transfers, etc , intake-release
area functions need to be among the most
secure and closely monitored in the facility 
The entry sequence to the receiving area should
be within the direct line of sight of the intakerelease
officerIdeally, although master control
will control the entry and exit doors, intakerelease
staff must be able to directly view:
 Entry of the vehicle into the sallyport 
 The officer and the arrestee leaving the
vehicle 
 The identity and circumstances of the transporting
officer prior to authorizing master control
to open the vehicle sallyport door 
 Movement to and through the door or vestibule
leading to the receiving area 
 Departure of the officer from the entry
vestibule 
 Departure of the officer and vehicle from the
vehicle sallyport 
This arrangement has the following advantages:
the intake-release officer can view the entire entrance
process and respond if trouble arises; the
arresting officer is confident that the situation is
under control, and the arrestee is deterred from
dangerous behavior by the intake-release officers’
constant and visible support; and the arrestee
can see where he/she is going next, thereby relieving
anxiety about the process 
If possible, in smaller facilities the
same sequence should be visible from
a constantly staffed post such as master
control because it will probably
have responsibility for operating sallyport
and entry doorsAny view that cannot be
provided to master control directly should be provided
through closed-circuit television (CCTV) 
Holding cells and the booking, fingerprint, and
photograph areas should also be visible from
master control or a constantly staffed post 
Receiving (“Booking”) Area Design
The following detailed functional-architectural
issues pertain to the areas required for the receiving
or “booking” activities of the intakerelease
componentThe receiving areas and
spaces are those involved when the arrestee is
initially received, but they are not involved with
the process of preparing inmates to be moved
to housing, inmates returning from court, or
inmates transferred from other facilitiesThe following
discussion of the receiving area covers
secure entry, arrestee processing, waiting and
temporary holding, outside contact, and miscellaneous
support 
Secure entry
The secure entry typically consists of two primary
architectural elements:
 Vehicle sallyport

Response: An enclosed vehicle sallyport is
the best solution to this issue as it provides
three key capabilities:
 A secure environment from which the
arrestee/inmate cannot escape or be
aided in escape once he/she leaves the
transport vehicle 
 Privacy separation from adjacent facilities
or land uses and the public 
 Protection from the weather 
E x h i b i t Vehicle Sallyport Showing Drive-
Although the first capability is essential, the others
are highly desirable depending on location,
climate, and economicsSome jurisdictions, for
example, only have a fenced area to provide a
basic degree of security (although passage of
contraband can remain a problem)This may be
sufficient in cases where the jail is on a remote
site, view conflicts are negligible, and the climate
minimizes the need for protection from the
weatherIn general, it is recommended that the
facility design provide a fully enclosed and securely
constructed vehicle sallyport 
Following are some considerations for the design
of the vehicle sallyport:
 A drive-through design for ease of operation,
versatility, and traffic flowThis means a vehicle
enters through one door/gate and exits
through a second door/gate (exhibit ) 
 Sufficient height and width of doors/gates and
adequate floor-to-ceiling clearance to accommodate
squad cars, x vehicles, vans, buses,
and/or emergency vehicles, including the
height added by antennas, lights, and sirens
and the width of ambulances and other emergency
vehicles (including mirrors)Doors/
gates that aretofeet high andfeet
wide are usually appropriate (exhibit ) 
 Sufficient floor area to accommodate:
Through Design
 
C h a p t e r :
I n t a k e R e l e a s e
The length of the largest vehicle that will
use the space (buses are approximately 
feet long, cars aretofeet long) 
The width of open car doors and arrestee/
inmate movement in the space (normally,
a minimum offeet for a sallyport that is
the width of a single vehicle) 
The number of vehicles to be allowed into
the sallyport at one time 
Any parking allowed for other official vehicles
in the space 
 A location adjacent to the secure vestibule entry
to the jail 
 Separate storage space for any items associated
with the vehicle sallyport to keep potentially
dangerous items out of the reach of inmates 
 An arrangement that allows the door through
which the arrestee/inmate will leave a squad
car to open directly at the point of secure entry
to the intake-release area 
 Sallyport doors/gates that are remotely
controlled by master control to keep them
easily operable and secure from tampering by
inmates 
 A pedestrian entry into the vehicle sallyport
from the outside, also controlled by master
control, to allow officer access after parking
the squad car and to allow access in the event
that overhead doors are temporarily not
functioning 
 An interlock for all vehicle and pedestrian
doors to prevent escapes or unauthorized
access 
 A radio or intercom to master control—at the
entrance to the sallyport and at the entrance to
the jail—to request entry and provide a means
of communication from within the sallyport 
 Direct visual or CCTV monitoring inside and
outside the sallyport by master control(Direct
monitoring of as much of the entry activity as
possible is valuable even if not all of the sallyport
can be seen without the help of CCTV )
 Weapons lockers in the vehicle sallyport to
keep handguns, Tasers, bullets, knives, and
other defensive equipment outside of the
intake-release area 
 Sufficient artificial lighting for nighttime use
and sufficient ventilation to exhaust vehicle
fumes 
 Natural light (if possible) to brighten the space
and calm the arrestee, through security-glazed
detention windows or skylights 
 An eyewash sink to wash out pepper spray 
 A hose bib and sloped floor drain for easy
cleaning

is essential if the following conditions
exist (exhibit ):

E x h i b i t Pedestrian Entry Vestibule
Vehicle sallyport

Vestibule
A variety of prebooking functions inappropriate
for the vehicle sallyport
must occur prior to allowing entry into
the intake-release area, such as filling
out arrest forms, securing warrants,
sobriety testing, initial pat search, initial
property receipt, and initial medical
screening 
There is a desire to limit the arresting
officer’s access to the booking area to
decrease tensions by eliminating him/
her from the process as quickly as
possible 
Another level of security at the point
of entry, in addition to a vehicle sallyport,
is desired (essentially creating
three barriers between the intakerelease
area and the outside) 


If a secure entry vestibule is required, the following
design considerations apply (exhibit ):
E x h i b i t Secure Pedestrian Entry Vestibule
Passthrough
Report writing
Breath test
Phone
Bench
Pat search
Intake area
Sallyport
Security
vestibule
Toilet
 Provide sufficient floor area to permit easy
arrestee/officer flow, including difficult flow
(e g , wrestling, stumbling, fighting, two persons
holding the inmate) 
 Provide sufficient floor area to accommodate
associated functions if the entry vestibule
serves as more than just a passagewaySome
possibilities include:
Sobriety testing (including storage for required
supplies) 
Computer workstations for arresting officers
for report writing and data entry 
Storage for forms and property bags 
Toilet facilities 
Telephones 
Waiting by the arrestee (consider a bench
with restraint capability) 
 Provide visibility from the booking station
and/or a constantly staffed post, but sufficient
screening from holding areas to provide privacy
for pat searches 
 Consider using sliding doors to eliminate the
need for the officer to manipulate swinging
doors and the arrestee at the same time 
 Interlock the vestibule doors and provide an
interlock override for emergency ingress or
egress 
 
C h a p t e r :
I n t a k e R e l e a s e
 Provide a means of voice communication from
the vestibule entry to intake-release and master
control positions 
 Provide a means by which documents and
property can be passed securely, such as a
secure pass-through, from the vestibule to the
intake-release area 
 Provide mats, nonslip surfaces, and drains to
neutralize the effects of mud, snow, ice, and
water brought into the area 
 Consider how larger numbers of arrestees and
arresting officers can be accommodated if
space is not available in the pedestrian entry
vestibule 
Sobriety testing
Issue: Sobriety testing areas, if provided, should
be affiliated with the entry sequence to limit arresting
officer entry into the jail and create easy
access to needed equipment 
Response: Some design considerations in
regard to sobriety testing include:
 Sobriety testing should be done at or
near the entry from the vehicle sallyport,
preferably in an area distinct
from the receiving area and accessible
from the secure pedestrian entry
vestibule 
 The area should be large enough to
accommodate the particular type of
sobriety testing equipment used;
storage of testing materials, supplies,
and forms; and seating for both the
arrestee and the officer(Temporary
seating is important because sometimes
arrestees must be observed for
a to -minute period prior to testing
and may need to sit in the sobriety
testing area during observation )
 It may be desirable to make the space
large enough to conduct motor skills
tests 
 Space for videotaping the sobriety and
motor skills testing process may be
needed 
 Toilet facilities should be provided in
this area if possible because arresting
officers may need to take a urine
sample or intoxicated individuals
frequently need to urinate and often
become nauseated 
Arrestee Processing
Three functions generate space needs for preadmission
arrestee processing in the intake-release
area:
 Booking 
 Fingerprinting 
 Photographing

the arresting officer vestibule between the vehicle sallyport and the intake
areaThe intake area is beyond the glass on the left

 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
The following detailed functional-architectural
issues address the design impacts of these
functions 
Booking
Issue: The booking of an arrestee must be
accommodated 
Response: The booking process is largely
a paperwork and/or data entry process in
which the following information is obtained
about the arrestee:
 Personal data 
 Arrest data 
 Criminal history 
 Arrest authorizations 
 Medical and mental health history 
 Other relevant information 
The area primarily needs work surfaces and
space around these surfacesSmaller jails usually
need only one or two booking stations because
of the relatively low volume of arrests and limited
staff resourcesLarger jails may be designed
with multiple booking stations to accommodate a
larger number of bookingsSome design issues to
consider include:
 Decide whether the arrestee and the intakerelease
officer will sit and/or stand during
the booking process and ensure that booking
counter surface heights correspond appropriately 
Note that high chairs and stools may
contribute to injuries of inmates who are intoxicated
or otherwise impaired 
 Locate the booking area as close to the secure
entry as possible 
 Create enough space on the inmates’ side of
the area to avoid congestion when others are
entering and using the area 
 Identify the equipment needed and allow sufficient
space for itEquipment may include the
following:
Intercoms 
Telephones 
Computer terminals and printers 
Typewriters 
File cabinets for active inmate records 
Forms and other miscellaneous supplies 
Containers for temporary or secure property
storage 
A writing surface 
Property receipt equipment, such as heatsealing
equipment for property bags 
A clock, inmate locator board, and bulletin
board 
Electronic controls for doors, lights, and
telephones 
 Decide whether the booking staff will be in
an open work area or an enclosed areaGiven
that the intake-release officer will likely receive
the inmate at the entry vestibule and
move him/her through the intake-release area,
an open booking area is more efficient and
practical 
 Provide storage in a safe or locked drawer or
cabinet for the temporary holding of cash and
other valuables 
 Provide storage for the temporary holding of
large property items, such as suitcases, backpacks,
and attaché cases 
Photographing/Fingerprinting
Issue: Photographing and fingerprinting functions
must be accommodated 
 
C h a p t e r :
I n t a k e R e l e a s e
Response: Photographing and fingerprinting
are routine functions of the booking
processThe primary question in regard to
planning space for this function is whether
they require a separate alcove or space or
whether they can be done from the booking
counterSome design considerations follow 
PhotographingDetermine the method of photographing
arresteesFor example:
 Digital video imaging(This is the preferred
technology for all booking photos )
mm photographs 
 Instant-print photographs 
 Multiple instant photographs, as produced by
the type of large portable machines seen in
shopping centers 
The method selected will frequently depend on
the needs of various law enforcement agencies
outside of the sheriff’s office (Federal Bureau of
Investigation, state bureaus of investigation, prosecuting
attorney’s office) and the need to have
reproducible photographsMost new facilities
now use digital video imaging techniques and
equipment for routine identification purposes 
 If photographing is done from the booking
counter, be sure to consider the convenience
of staff in posing the inmate and returning to
the camera to take the pictures 
 Provide aboveand below-counter storage for
equipment, supplies, and forms associated
with both photographing and fingerprinting
inmatesThese items include booking cards,
film, and development chemicalsIf chemicals
are used, they should be stored in a locked
cabinet and should not be used in areas that
are accessible to inmates 
 Provide flexibility for using a height chart
as part of the photographing arrangement 
(Criminal investigators may not want a height
chart so they can use jail photographs for
photo lineup )
 Provide storage for the board and identification
letters used in the photographing process,
if they are not inserted automatically by the
photographing equipment 
 Provide ample artificial lighting to enhance the
quality of photographs 
 In arranging space and equipment, consider
how photographs might be takenFor example,
although the usual practice is to take a single
shot from the front and shots from both sides
of the individual, another idea is to use a mirror
system that allows one shot to provide
front face, left face, and right face views 
FingerprintingIdentify the method of fingerprinting
to be usedSome methods use chemicals
or heat processes instead of traditional ink pads 
Most modern facilities use electronic fingerprinting,
which links fingerprints electronically to
statewide and national databases 
Fingerprint and photographing stations in a large booking area

 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Make sure there is sufficient room on either side
of the fingerprint pad or equipment area so that
staff can stand while working with the arrestee 
Provide a sink for hand washing before and after
fingerprinting, a paper towel dispenser, and a
waste receptacle 
Temporary waiting and holding
Because it is not always possible to immediately
process every arrestee who arrives at the jail and
some facilities may choose to allow arrestees to
wait in the intake-release area for several hours
while bond arrangements are being made, the
provision of temporary holding or waiting areas
is critical to the operation of the intake-release
area 
All holding or waiting spaces should be easily observable
from a staff postHowever, care must be
taken to ensure adequate privacy when toilets are
included in the spacesView conflicts between
holding spaces and between holding spaces and
other areas of the facility must also be controlled 
Issue: Secure single-occupancy holding cells
should be available for arrestees or inmates
who have been violent or combative or who otherwise
need temporary confinement apart from
other arrestees 
Response: The characteristics of a secure
holding room for violent or combative inmates
might include:
 A single cell oftosquare feet
(check state standards for applicable
requirements) 
 A large security-glazed window in the
cell door and/or front wall 
 Sufficient door width to allow two officers
to place a combative inmate in
the cell and to allow for easy entry
of a “restraint chair” and emergency
equipment 
 High-security hardware 
 Detention plumbing fixtures behind a
privacy screen that allows some view
control (normally a height of about
 toinches is adequate)Consider
installing a remote flushing feature to
prevent the loss of potential evidence 
 Fixed seating (sufficiently wide and
long so the inmate can lie down, if
possible) 
 Natural light through secure windows,
skylights, or clerestories, if possible 
 Artificial lighting controlled by staff 
 At least-foot ceilings, if possible,
to minimize random assaults on the
surface or fixtures at the ceiling (e g ,
smoke and heat detectors, sprinkler
heads, light fixtures) 
 Durable finishes and materials 
Issue: Multipurpose secure space is needed
for holding arrestees who may not be appropriate
for an open waiting area (e g , arrestees
who are under the influence of alcohol) and
during staging for transport to court or to
other locations 
Response: The characteristics of multipurpose
holding space include:
 Multiple-occupancy holdingThe
recommendation is for a room that
is a minimum ofsquare feet for
single occupancy;square feet
should be added for each additional
person the cell is designed to hold
(check state standards for applicable
requirements) 
 
C h a p t e r :
I n t a k e R e l e a s e
 Fixed seating (benches are preferred to
allow seating for a number of people
in the space) 
 A detention-quality toilet and sink
behind a privacy screen, which allows
some view control by staff and some
privacy for the arrestee 
 Large windows in the door and sidewall
for observation from the booking/
staff station in the receiving area 
 Mediumto high-security hardware 
 A floor drain 
 Nine-foot ceilings, if possible 
 Durable finishes and materials 
Issue: An open waiting area should be available
for cooperative arrestees who are awaiting
booking or pretrial release via bonding or other
measures 
Response: The characteristics of open waiting
areas might include:
 Fixed durable seating (such as that
used in airports) in the receiving area,
allowing approximatelysquare feet
per seat 
 Access to a telephone 
 Access to a toilet and sink in a
private space 
 Access to a drinking fountain 
 Good visibility from the booking/staff
station and/or master control 
 A television and reading material, if
desired, to keep arrestees occupied 
 Signs that provide information about
the receiving process, bonding, legal
assistance, and basic legal rights
(knowledge of this information reduces
fear of the unknown and thereby
has a calming effect) 
 A brochure rack to provide information
about alcohol/drug problems,
legal assistance, and other topics, as
appropriate 
 As much screening as possible from
the view of individuals in holding
cells 
 A location out of the main circulation
path to avoid congestion and security
risks 
 Natural light through secure windows,
skylights, or clerestories, if possible

Outside contact
Issue: Provisions must be made so arrestees
can have contact with family, friends, lawyers,
and bondspersons while in the receiving area 
Response: Arrestees usually have contact
with outside persons in a visiting area (exhibit
), video visitation booth, and/or
via the telephoneIn some jurisdictions it
may be necessary for arrestees to have visits
with family, attorneys, and/or bondspersons
while they are in the receiving areaUnless
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
a common visiting area is located next to
the intake area, it may be desirable to minimize
the movement of arrestees by having a
visiting area for bondspersons or lawyers as
part of the intake-release areaIf a visitation
area is provided, it should have the following
characteristics:
 Visibility from a constantly staffed
post or a post that is occupied during
the visit 
 A controlled point of entry for the
bondsperson or lawyerThis point of
entry should have remotely operated
locks with status indication (locked or
unlocked) and it should be monitored
by CCTV unless a direct line of sight
to the entry can be established from a
constantly staffed post without creating
view conflicts with inmate areas 
In addition, an intercom and camera
should be located so that either master
control or the booking staff can make
an initial identification by voice and
visual contact 
 A secure barrier between the arrestee
and the visitor; the barrier should be
created by using secure wall materials
and security glass and framing
(as discussed in, “Visiting
Areas”) 
 A means by which papers requiring an
arrestee’s signature can be passed securely
from the lawyer or bondsperson
to the arresteeThis should be accomplished
with minimum staff effortA
lockable paper pass is a typical option 
 A means by which facility staff can
communicate to the visitor side to respond
to requests for information and
to notify individuals about the end of
a visit 
Telephones with outside lines should be available
throughout the intake areaThe primary question
is how arrestees can have access to telephones
within secure singleand multiple-occupancy
holding cellsSeveral options are: ( ) install
wall-mounted telephones in the holding spaces,
( ) move the arrestee from the cell to a central
telephone location, or ( ) provide a telephone
jack in the walls so that a telephone unit can be
passed through a food pass or opening in the
holding cell door for the arrestee’s useThe
choice of method depends on the visibility of the
cells, the behavior expected of the individuals in
the cells, the availability of staff to move inmates,
and how available the facility administration
wants telephone contact to beIn cases where
the telephones are installed, the intake officer
should have controls available to turn the phones
off both individually and as a group 
Booking area with open waiting (including access to a television,
telephones, a clock, and restrooms) 
(Photograph courtesy of Liebert & Associates )
In general, the most efficient use of staff time and
best access for arrestees is to place telephones
in holding cells, with the exception of those cells
 
C h a p t e r :
I n t a k e R e l e a s e
used to house very violent or suicidal arrestees 
(If the same holding cells are used to temporarily
hold inmates awaiting transport to court or
other facilities, a means must be available to shut
off telephone access because allowing telephone
calls just prior to transport violates sound security
procedures )
If the telephone will be used outside the holding
cells, some level of privacy should be provided
for telephone callsA small alcove with appropriate
acoustic treatments is the best solution 
Miscellaneous support
Issue: Miscellaneous support requirements
should be accommodated 
Response: The following elements should
be considered in the design of the receiving
area:
 Staff toilet 
 Inmate records and files 
 General supply storage 
 Janitor’s closet 
 Hose bib or hose 
 Drinking fountains 
 Clocks 
 Trash cans and wastebaskets 
Admissions Area Design
The following functional-architectural issues
pertain to the admissions activities of the intakerelease
component; that is, they deal with the
areas required for processing arrestees for housing
in the facility if they cannot be released from
the receiving areaThe admissions area is often
called the “dress in” areaThese issues also pertain
to the admission of inmates who are returning
from court or who are being transferred from
another facility 
Shower/change or “dress in”
Issue: Facilities should be provided so the inmate
can shower and change clothing 
Response: Inmates must have a place to
shower and change into facility-issued
clothing before entering their assigned
housing unit (assuming this is part of the
facility’s operational practice)The characteristics
of this area might include:
 Privacy from the booking area and
from the facility in general 
 Backup audio surveillance and/or
communication with a constantly
staffed post 
 Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA)-compliant shower, toilet, and
sink fixtures 
 A drying area with a nonslip surface,
a small bench, and hooks or bars to
place towels and clothes 
 Excellent ventilation, especially if the
area is also used for inmate decontamination 
 Shelves for prepared sets of clothing,
linen, and toiletries for incoming inmates,
preferably in an alcove open
to the area or in a securable cabinet
within the shower/change area 
 A modesty screen behind which an
inmate can undress and dress when
a strip search is not allowable(In
recent years considerable litigation
has limited strip searches of certain
arrestees, such as nonviolent felons,
misdemeanants, and traffic offenders 
Court rulings preclude the viewing of
unclothed inmates of both genders
during the search or clothing-exchange
process )
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Sufficient floor area within the space
to allow easy movement of at least
two people and to allow the officer to
conduct unclothed body searches (if
applicable) 
 A small work surface and form storage
area to allow the officer to document
the receipt of property and clothing
and to obtain the inmate’s signature 
Storage/issue
Issue: Storage, receipt, and issue of a wide variety
of items must be accommodated in association
with the shower and change area 
Response: There is a need to store, receive,
and/or issue the following types of items
in spaces adjacent to and easily accessible
from the shower and change area:
 Street clothes 
 Personal property 
 Bulk property (e g , suitcases, backpacks,
duffel bags, attaché cases) 
 Facility-issued clothing 
 Linens 
 Mattresses and pillows 
 Toiletries 
Some of these storage capabilities might be consolidated 
For example, it is common to store all
inmate property (clothing, wallets, keys, suitcases)
in one area that is secured from access by
inmates and most staffIt is also common to consolidate
linen, clothing, and toiletry storage 
ADA-compliant shower with grab bars, a retractable seat
(located behind the curtain), and dual-height shower heads 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )
Issuing methodsThe extent to which items are
stored near the shower and change area depends
on the method of issuing items to incoming inmates
and how those items are expected to arrive
at the assigned cell areaFor example, some
facilities will issue all items to the inmate at the
shower and change area, thus expecting him/
her to carry them (including the bulky mattress)
to the cellOther facilities provide inmates with
clothing and toiletries during the dress-in process
and make sure that other essential items (i e , a
cleaned and disinfected mattress and linens) are
in the cell when the inmate arrivesThis distribution
approach suggests that storage facilities
should be located near the housing areas rather
than near the admissions area 
Valuable personal property (wallets, credit cards,
jewelry, etc ) may be stored in lockable drawers
at the booking desk or in a space immediately
adjacent to the booking desk that is accessible
from the receiving area, the admissions area,
and the point of releaseOften, if the arrestee is
housed, valuable property will be moved to a
secure vault until the inmate is releasedSpecial
clothing bags with pouches that can be used for
secure storage of property are also availableAs
noted earlier, if this approach is used, the area
used to store street clothing must be secured and
controlled by a few select officers to avoid loss of
property 
 
C h a p t e r :
I n t a k e R e l e a s e
Storage space factorsThe amount of space
needed for the storage of facility-issued clothing,
linens, and toiletries will depend on the following
factors:
 The variety of items issued by the facility 
 The method of exchanging soiled articles for
clean articlesWill a full supply of linens replace
those being laundered or can the same
linens be removed, washed, and returned?
Likewise, will all clothing need to be replaced
while soiled clothing is being washed?
 The amount of additional clothing required
means that proper sizes must be available for
all inmates (including during periods with a
high population) and that damaged goods can
be taken out of circulation for repair without
creating a shortage of needed articles 
 The length of time toiletry supplies are expected
to last, given the facility’s booking and
use patterns 
Large storage room for inmate personal property in individual
color-coded bags 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )
A key functional-architectural component that is
affected by decisions regarding admissions and
storage requirements is the laundry, which is
closely affiliated with the linen and clothing storage
areasIf these areas are affiliated with the
intake-release area to accommodate desired operational
practices, it is critical that the laundry
area be adjacent to the linen and clothing supply
areas 
Release Area Design
Issue: The need for a separate release area
should be considered 
Response: Because the receiving and admissions
areas frequently serve as the release
area in smaller jails, the following should be
considered when developing the layout of
the intake-release component (exhibit ):
 The need to assemble a group of inmates
to be transported or released
without interfering with intake
operations 
 The need to apply restraints to a group
of inmates who are being transported
to court, which requires a group
staging area and access to restraint
equipment

General Housing
The general housing component of a jail consists
of those areas that accommodate the
typical or “average” inmateThis inmate
is defined as one who does not require special
housing accommodations because of behavior,
condition, or unique separation requirements 
The following types of inmates are generally
considered inappropriate for general housing:
 Work release/periodic-confinement inmates 
 Inmate workers 
 Protective custody inmates 
 Juveniles to be adjudicated as adults 
 Inmates requiring medical isolation 
 Disciplinary detainees 
 Suicidal inmates 
 Mentally ill (non-medication-compliant)
inmates 
 Violent and predatory inmates 
 , “Special Housing,” addresses the
housing needs of the types of inmates listed
aboveInmates with disabilities were historically
thought to require separate special housing but
can be accommodated within the general population 
Their needs are described in this
The vast majority of the general housing inmate
population in a facility consists of adult men
in either preor posttrial status who have been
charged with a felony, misdemeanor, municipal,
or traffic offenseGeneral housing can also contain
adult women in similar categories (although
in appropriately separate general housing areas) 
Security risk levels can vary within general housing,
ranging from low to high

(Photograph courtesy of Jim Rowenhorst )
Functionally, the basic mission of general housing
areas is to accommodate the sleeping, modesty,
personal hygiene, personal interaction, safety,
and security needs of the typical inmate and the
management, safety, security, personal, and professional
needs of the staff working in the area 
The general housing area is the focal point of a
jail design and represents a substantial portion of
the costs and square footage involved with a jail 
General housing areas minimally include the following
types of spaces:
 Inmate cells or dormitories 
 Dayrooms (central activity areas serving a
group of cells or a dormitory) 
 Staff control posts 
 Security vestibules 
 Shower/toilet areas 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Miscellaneous support spaces: multipurpose
rooms, storage, janitor closet, and so forth 
Historically, the inadequacies of the general (and
special) housing areas have been the target of
lawsuits and standardsTypical shortcomings cited
about cells have included multiple occupancy
and the resulting lack of personal safety when
staff supervision is inadequate, limited square
footage of as little assquare feet per inmate,
and a lack of personal privacyCourts have found
artificial lighting insufficient for reading, natural
light frequently lacking, and general environmental
conditions substandard 
The traditional arrangement of cellblocks—
principally the classic back-to-back, steelconstructed
cellblocks surrounded by a barred
officer corridor—has been judged to be ineffective
in the proper supervision of the inmate
populationIts deficiencies include limiting the
officer’s view and control, providing inadequate
dayroom space, offering minimal true separation
capabilities, and providing severely limited
sound, odor, or smoke containment capabilities 
In recent years, general housing areas have
changed considerably in characterThe emphasis
has shifted to an improved environmental quality
and improved safetyIt has also shifted toward
creation of a more normal environment that
tends to reinforce desired behavior, express more
respect for the inmate, and provide better working
conditions for staff 
Direct and constant view into all parts of the
housing units is increasingly emphasizedThe
use of modern technology to provide better security
and control in support of staff efforts is
increasing, and a wider variety of materials is
being used instead of the traditional steel bar
and plate construction 
Key Decisions
As the role of the general housing component
is evaluated, the following decisions should be
made because they have a fundamental effect on
design requirements:
 What classifications of inmates will make up
the general population of the jail? How will
they be grouped and separated from each other?
(More information is available in ,
“Classification/Separation,” in section )
 What degree of flexibility in housing unit design
will be required to accommodate fluctuations
in the nature of the inmate population?
 What will be the occupancy level of inmate
sleeping areas—single occupancy, double occupancy,
or multiple occupancy? (See 
, “Single Versus Multiple Occupancy,” in
section )
 Will each housing unit have its own dayroom?
How many inmates will use it at one time?

furniture in the dayroom

C h a p t e r :
G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
How many hours per day will the dayroom be
in use?
 What surveillance or supervision methods
will be used? (See , “Surveillance/
Supervision,” in section )
 What programs and services will be brought to
the housing areas in lieu of moving inmates to
the programs and services?
 How will emergency egress be made from the
housing units?
 How will inmates with disabilities be accommodated,
and how must housing design concepts
be configured to accommodate those
with disabilities?
 How will natural light be introduced into cells
and dayrooms?
 How will expansion of bed capacity be
achieved?
Detail Issues
The following discussion of detailed functionalarchitectural
issues is limited to the general
residential areas of the facility, including female
housing areasHousing for special groups is addressed
in, “Special Housing,” but
many of the issues discussed here also apply
to special housing areasThe general housing
functional-architectural issues are divided into
several discrete areas:
 Basic design 
 Cell design 
 Dayroom design 
 Staff control post design 
 Miscellaneous design issues:
Security vestibule 
Showers 
Storage 
Janitor closet 
Program or multipurpose space 
Visiting area 
Basic Design Issues
The following issues apply to the overall design
of general housing units: activities, users, movement,
arrangement, security, environment, fire
safety, and plumbing 
Activities
Issue: Identify common housing unit activities 
Response: Many varied activities occur within
a housing unitSome of the more typical
activities include:
 Sleeping 
 Attending to personal hygiene and
grooming 
 Dressing 
 Storing personal articles 
 Talking with other inmates 
 Communicating with staff 
 Reading and writing 
 Recreating (passively and/or actively) 
 Cleaning and maintaining the area 
 Eating 
 Receiving and sending mail 
 Watching television 
 Telephoning attorneys, friends, and
family 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
The design must acknowledge the potential for
less common events, including:
 Emergency communications between inmates
and staff 
 Vandalism 
 Escape attempts 
 Contraband passage 
 Assaults on inmates or staff 
 Emergency evacuation 
Note: The needs of inmates with disabilities
(physical, visual, auditory) must be accommodated
in all routine activities and atypical events 
Users
Issue: The design should accommodate changes
in the makeup of the average daily population 
Response: Some flexibility must be built into
the design to accommodate changes in the
makeup of the jail population from year to
year, month to month, and even day to day 
This can be achieved by:
 Subdividing a general population
housing area into smaller areas
so there is enough flexibility to
create “swing” units that can be assigned
to different general residential
populations—high security or low,
male or female 
 Providing security equipment and
hardware that can accommodate any
of the assigned groups, although this
tends to make the unit higher in security
orientationConsequently, lower
security populations must be distinguished
from higher security populations
through different management
approaches 
More information on the issue of housing unit
flexibility is given in , “Classification/
Separation ”
Issue: Providing adequate housing
capacity and environments for female
inmates in smaller jails presents special
problems because of the small
number of female inmates 
Response: Female inmates have historically
represented less thanpercent of the average
daily population in a jail, although the
percentage has increased in recent years 
Some smaller jails do not house female inmates
beyond initial booking and holding
because of inadequate separation capabilities,
reluctance to dedicate a housing unit to
a small number of inmates, and/or the difficulties
of providing same-sex staffingAdditionally,
even though there are usually few
female inmates, their impact on bed space
needs can be significant on days when several
female arrestees enter the facility 
The key to handling this population is to create
one or more small swing housing units that can
be used either for women or for men when not
needed for womenSince this area could contain
high-security inmates of either sex, it should be
under constant surveillanceProviding constant
surveillance also helps ensure that male staff can
supervise female inmates without fear of modesty
conflicts or accusations of sexual misconduct 
In facilities with a typically small female population,
it is recommended that all female inmates—
including those on work release or inmate worker
status—be housed in the same area, although
not necessarily in the same housing unitClose
supervision and management of this area will be
required to ensure that inmate-to-inmate conflicts
and contraband passage do not occur 
 
C h a p t e r :
G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
Movement
Issue: Identify the degree of movement
between housing units and other areas of
the facility 
Response: Many activities occur in a jail
besides the basic housing functionsIf these
activities occur elsewhere in the building,
inmates and staff must move to themAnother
approach is to have selected activities
be part of the housing area complex or
to actually accommodate them within the
housing unitsConsequently, the manner in
which programs and activities are to be accessed
is a critical element of housing area
design 
It is generally beneficial to minimize the amount
of movement that occurs in a facilityAs the security
level of the inmate increases, the management
benefits of limited movement also increase 
The following kinds of activities have been integrated
into housing unit designs to minimize
inmate movement:
 Passive recreation (e g , television (TV), table
games) 
 Indoor exercise (e g , basketball, volleyball,
weightlifting) 
 Outdoor exercise 
 Dining 
 Counseling 
 Programs 
 Sick call 
 Visiting 
 Telephone use 
 Video arraignments 
Issue: Movement should be controlled 
Response: Movement within the housing
units and to and from other areas of the facility
should always be under staff controlTo
facilitate staff control of movement within
the housing area, all cell, dayroom, and related
housing area spaces into which inmates
have access should be controlled by doors
with remotely operated locking systems and
keysIt is also highly desirable to have all
doors in the housing unit under direct view,
preferably from a constantly staffed post, as
is characteristic of both direct supervision
and remote surveillance designs 
Even though a remote observation or direct supervision
staff post may have control over all housing
unit doors, these doors should also be controllable
by master control through an override function
that neutralizes local control functions

Movement to areas outside the housing units can
be controlled as follows:
 Under direct staff supervision or observation
(preferred) 
 Under staff observation through closed-circuit
television (CCTV) monitors supplemented, as
appropriate, by audio communication systems 
 By using a pass system that specifies an
amount of time for an inmate to leave one
point in the facility and arrive at another
point, moving through areas not directly
observed by staff or through areas indirectly
observed by CCTV monitors 
Arrangement
Issue: The arrangement of housing unit spaces
should facilitate control and movement 
Response: Following are several general arrangement
considerations that facilitate control
and movement:
 In remote surveillance housing areas,
all primary spaces should be observable
by staff from outside the housing
unit areaThese spaces include cells,
dayrooms, egress doors, showers, and
associated program or support areas 
 Nonhousing activities associated with
the housing units must be easily accessible
and within view of staff 
 Blind spots should be avoided or minimized
to the greatest extent possible 
 In designs where two tiers of cells
share a common dayroom:
The design should provide a workable
view angle toward second-tier spaces,
even if this requires a raised staff position
(exhibit ) 
Open housing control booth with a good view of cell fronts, dayrooms, and
mezzanine walkways 
(Photograph courtesy of Liebert & Associates )
Stairs providing access to the second
tier should have risers that allow view
through to areas behind the stair 
Second-tier railings should allow view
through to the cell faces, but be high
enough ( inches or more) to provide
adequate safety for persons on the
walkway 
Walkways should be wide enough to allow
easy movement where cell doors that
swing out are used, but not so wide as to
unduly limit view from staff positions 
Midlevel dayrooms should not obscure
views or provide hiding places at the
lower-tier level 
Other considerations are discussed in section
and in subsequent s in section 
Some designs feature “sunken” first tiers so that
access and staff positions are essentially at a
second-tier level 
 
C h a p t e r :
G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
 Access to housing units should be through
either a security vestibule or an adjacent corridor
that serves as a control corridor by effectively
separating the housing area from other
portions of the building 
 Emergency egress routes from the housing
areas should not only comply with fire codes
and standards but should be easily accessible
and controllableAn important element of
egress that affects arrangement is the provision
of two ways out of all housing areas where required
(desirable everywhere) 
A key aspect of creating an egress door between
housing units is doing so in a manner that inhibits
sound transmission and prevents contraband
passageAnother consideration for egress is the
possible need for, or use of, a second means of
egress off the second tier of a two-tier housing
unitThis implies that protected stair towers be
integrated into the arrangement of the housing
unit (exhibit ) 
Security
Issue: Inmates must be protected from violence,
assault, and exploitation by other inmates 
Response: Following are essential considerations
in designing to protect inmates from
each other:
 A classification system and a range
of separate housing units(More information
is available in,
“Special Housing ”)
 Selection of a mode of supervision
based on careful analysis of the
relative strengths, weaknesses, and
efficiencies of the three most common
combinations of architectural styles/
supervision approaches (remote surveillance,
direct supervision, and linear
intermittent surveillance) and their
applicability to different classifications
and groups of inmates 
 Adequate numbers of qualified and
trained staff 
 Choice of cell or dormitory occupancy
level in conjunction with appropriate
staffing to provide for inmate safety
and reduce the chances of inmates being
exploited, coerced, or assaulted by
other inmates 
Issue: Differences in security and custody levels
should be considered in the design of the physical
environment 
Response: Even the general population
of the jail consists of different behavioral

types, each of which poses different levels
of security risk and custody needsThese
can be accommodated through varying approaches
to design 
The key issues that influence design revolve
around classification, surveillance, and staffIn
facilities that provide inadequate classification
and separation capabilities and that are intermittently
monitored, the physical plant must provide
greater levels of securityWithout constant staff
control, however, it is difficult to decide what is
truly “enough” physical security 
Regardless of the inmate type or the surveillance
mode employed, the basic security envelope of
the housing area should always be adequately
constructed to prevent escape and control contraband
passageConsequently, major physical
differences due to surveillance and custody level
occur primarily within the housing units 
Exhibit -gives examples of some of the chief
areas of difference within general population
housing areas, assuming constant remote surveillance
or direct supervisionThese examples are
not meant to describe the full range of options
available, only to illustrate general differences in
physical securityIt is conceivable that the options
under “lesser physical security” could be
applied to high-security groups or vice versaThe
key to security is classification, staff presence,
and the surveillance/supervision approach 
Issue: Providing for the physical safety of staff 
Response: Physical safety of staff is an often
overlooked element of housing area design 
Depending on the surveillance/supervision
approach used, some design considerations
may include:
 Slightly raised, open counter areas
in the dayroom or enclosed, secured
staff posts with solid, security-glazed
partitions to allow visibility but prevent
physical contact, coupled with
intercoms or speaker boxes for communication 
 Direct visual backup of staff entering
or working around housing units 
 Body alarms, radios, and/or panic
alarms linked to secured, constantly
staffed posts such as master control 
 CCTV and audio backup from inside
the housing area to master control 
 Design of locking systems to minimize
escape potential if a roving officer
or the housing area control officer is
assaulted by inmates (e g , all locks
remotely operated so that the roving
officer has no keys, or keys only to
immediate areas such as cells and
closets, but no exit keys) 
 Secured openings (passthroughs)
through which items exchanged between
staff and inmates (e g , food,
drinks, clothing, linens, mail, packages,
and paperwork such as sick call
requests and commissary slips) can be
passed without entry into the housing
unit (this should only be considered
in the highest security housing areas
where the likelihood of staff assault is
great) 
Environment
Issue: The need or desire for natural light in
housing areas should be balanced against security
concerns 
Response: All inmate cells and dayrooms
should have exposure to natural lightNatural
light is valuable in that it contributes to
good physical and mental health and to a

more normal-appearing environment that encourages
or reinforces more normal behavior 
Providing natural light, however, also poses
potential security or management problems:
 Escape 
 Passage of contraband 
 Vandalism 
 View conflicts with persons outside
the facility 
 View conflicts between housing units 
The greatest problems occur with cell windows
to the exterior of the facility because cells are
generally a less observable part of the housing
area and penetration of the window can result in
penetration of the main security envelope 
Cell window design can help mitigate escape,
contraband passage, and vandalism problems 
View conflicts with cells and dayrooms can be
controlled by:
 Orienting windows toward interior courtyards
or screened areas 
 Placing windows high in the wall (exhibit
) 
 Using reflective or heavily smoked glazing
products to limit view, especially during daylight
hoursUse of translucent, rather than
transparent, glass products allows in light but
obscures the view to the outside 
One way to minimize window security problems
is to introduce borrowed light to the cells from
other spaces rather than provide an exterior window
in each cellHistorically, this was done by
placing cells on the interior of the housing area
(typically back-to-back with other cells, divided
by a chase) and separating them from windows
by a dayroom and a perimeter corridorAn aesthetic
value to this was that the dayroom—the
place where inmates spend the majority of their
daytime hours—received the most natural light 
A common problem with this approach was that
the windows were typically limited in size and
heavily screened to minimize escape potential and
eliminate view conflictsConsequently, limited
amounts of light were afforded to the occupants
of the cellsIt also tended to negate remote observation
possibilities in which a full view of cell
fronts and some portions of the cell interiors were
provided from a point outside the housing unit

C h a p t e r :
G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
A variation on the borrowed light concept for remote
observation housing designs is to use clerestories,
skylights, and adjacent outdoor areas to
introduce natural light in significant quantities instead
of using exterior cell windows (exhibit ) 
E x h i b i t Use of Clerestory Window To
Introduce Light Into Interior Cells

Even then, the amount of light actually entering
the cells would still be limited; especially if modesty
demands meant that the cell face (walls and
door) was largely solid 
To introduce natural light directly into cells but
fully eliminate view conflicts, some facilities
employ translucent or obscured glazing, thereby
sacrificing all viewThis tends to occur most
often with ground-level cells on restricted urban
sites where the possibilities for controlled exterior
areas are limited 
If natural light is provided in the dayroom via
a window or clerestory, it is preferable that the
light not shine directly toward the officer inside
or outside the housing unitOtherwise, the glare
from the light source could increase eye strain,
reduce effective view control, and cause glare,
making it difficult to read computer screensIf
the window or clerestory is out of the officer’s
view, it should also be inaccessible to inmates

Issue: Basic environmental needs should be
accommodated 
Response: The environmental quality of
housing areas can make them more livable
and influence inmate behaviorCooperative,
calm behavior is not reinforced by noisy,
cold, dark areas thick with unpleasant
odorsMost state jail standards and building
codes require basic environmental quality 
Some special considerations for jail housing
areas include sound, artificial light, and
temperature 
SoundSound quality is one of the more difficult
environmental problems, resulting from the
typically hard surfaces and many sources of
sound, for example:
 Electric locks (solenoid and motorized) 
 Slamming doors, sliding doors 
 Inmate voices 
 Electronic communications (intercoms,
public address) 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Showers 
 Toilets 
 TVs and radios 
These frequently combine to produce high sound
levels and, with hard surfaces, generate reverberations
(echoes) that can obscure conversation
and be irritating to both inmates and staff 
Following are some solutions to the problem of
sound:
 More textured surfaces (e g , concrete masonry
units—versus concrete or steel plate—acoustic
ceiling panels, carpet on floors or selected wall
surfaces) 
 More irregular surfaces (e g , angled walls, pan
joist structural systems)
 Solid cell and dayroom faces (e g , block, hollow
metal or solid wood doors, security glazing)
instead of bars or grating 
 Quieter locks (e g , electric motor or pneumatic
versus solenoid) 
 Swing doors instead of sliding doors 
 Showers pocketed within the walls of the dayroom
rather than steel shower cabinets in and
facing the dayroom 
 TVs with localized speakers controlled by staff
rather than inmates, or TVs that can be heard
only with headsets purchased by the inmates
or provided to indigent inmates 
 Separate TV-watching rooms adjacent to, and
viewable from, the dayroom 
Artificial lightHistorically, artificial light has
been a problem because of its insufficiency in
providing adequate lighting and because of its
constancyThe latter frequently results in vandalized
fixtures when inmates get no relief from
light at nightSome solutions:
 Provide night lighting capabilities in cells and
dayrooms that allow primary lighting to be
shut off 
 Provide selected categories of inmates some
control over their cell lighting 
 Avoid light sources that shine toward the jail
officer looking into the area 
 Avoid using lighting with unnatural light spectrums,
such as high-pressure sodium fixtures
that are energy efficient but more suitable to
street lighting because of their yellowish color 
 Provide staff with control of the lighting in
their spaces, adjacent housing area corridors,
and housing units, for good vision and reduced
eye strain 
TemperatureComplaints about temperature most
frequently relate to that in cellsThis is because
cells are often made of hard, cold surfaces; do
not have individual temperature control; and are
on an exterior wallIn addition, their heat source
is normally at the front of the cell, the opposite
of typical building practiceThe design process
should evaluate ways to get the heat to the outside
wall and at the floor in a vandal-resistant
manner 
Pan joist construction refers to a one-way structural system using a ribbed slab formed with pansThe system achieves economy
through the reuse of standard forming pansSpecial design provisions for pan joists have been established through many years
of construction experienceStandard pan forms produce dimensions oforinches, and depths range from toinches,
although other sizes are availableSpans normally range fromtofeet, but may be extended by post-tensioningJoists may
have openings in the ribs to accommodate mechanical systemsSlabs between the joists can readily accommodate duct openings
or sleeves

Fire safety
Issue: Fire safety is a critical consideration in
the design of housing areas 
Response: Most injuries and deaths resulting
from fire or smoke inhalation in jails occur
in the housing areasThe National Fire
Protection Association’s Life Safety Code®
specifically addresses jail safety issues It is
strongly recommended that planners refer to
the Life Safety Code®, conduct a thorough review
of local codes, and consult with fire inspection
officials early in the design process 
There are several special issues to consider besides
providing proper means of egress and proper
detection, alarm, and suppression systems:
 Using fire-retardant, nontoxic materials wherever
possible and consistent with general
design/environmental goals 
 Providing a place to store extinguishers and
airpacks that is easily accessible to all staff
positions 
 Providing backup keys in a secure area outside
the jail perimeter 
 Providing emergency group unlocking capabilities
in all housing units, with master control
override 
 Developing fire zones within the facility perimeter
to prevent emergency release from the
building being the only option (exhibit ) 
Creating an outdoor retention yard that might
also serve as the outdoor exercise area is also
worth considering 
 Avoiding open, barred, or grilled cell and dayroom
fronts, which are incapable of providing
any fire or smoke containment 
 Consulting local fire inspectors on the use of
security glass and passthrough openings in
housing unit dayroom walls, which frequently
abut egress corridors, thereby potentially conflicting
with fire ratings for those wallsVariances
may have to be sought on the basis of
security need and be justified by the provision
of a full range of detection, alarm, suppression,
and evacuation measures 
 Creating a “no smoking” facility or limiting
smoking to specified areas in jails where
smoking is still allowed 
 Installing built-in electric cigarette lighters for
inmate use to eliminate the need for matches
and lighters in inmate-occupied areas 
 Using flame-retardant, nontoxic mattresses and
pillows 
 Considering how firefighters will gain access
to various parts of the building 
Plumbing
Issue: The need for plumbing fixtures depends
on the operation of the housing unit 
Response: It is generally accepted, and required
by most standards, that all cells and

dayrooms have toilet and sink facilities 
However, the key issue regarding their location
is one of access 
Individual cells generally have toilet and sink
fixtures because there is an expectation that
inmates will be locked in their cells at night and
have no alternative bathroom facilitiesHowever,
in constantly monitored areas backed up by roving
officers (especially direct supervision areas),
it is possible that inmates could use centralized
facilities at nightThis seems feasible because inmates
use centralized facilities and/or cell facilities
without incident during the day, when many
more activities and distractions are occurring 
Having centralized facilities rather than in-cell
facilities (thereby creating “dry cells”) does not
necessarily preclude the ability to lock down
inmates during disturbances or inspections,
because inmates can be individually released
through remotely controlled cell-locking mechanisms 
Also, additional staff are typically assigned
to the facility during disturbances and
inspections to provide necessary security support
and thus offset potential problems 
Toilet and sink fixtures accessible from the dayroom
are required when the operation of the
housing unit includes denying inmates access to
their cells for significant portions of the day (or
when there are no fixtures in the cells)If such
an operational approach is not, and never will
be, adopted, toilet and sink fixtures in the dayroom
are merely a convenience 
Issue: The design must accommodate potential
problems with damaged or inoperable plumbing
fixtures 
Response: Some issues to consider follow 
 Providing floor drains to accommodate
accidental or purposeful spillage from
fixtures in cells or dayroomsDrains
should be placed outside cells to minimize
inmate attempts to block them 
 Making pipe chases readily accessible
to maintenance staff and sufficiently
large to allow easy repair 
 Locating shutoff valves strategically to
allow staff to stop water flow in specific
areasOne such location might be
a secure space accessible from outside
of the building to provide some level
of control in the event that inmates
take over the jailThis can also be
accomplished through the use of electronic
controls in master control, at
the officer’s desk, or at the housing
control station 
Sleeping Area Design Issues
The following functional-architectural issues apply
to inmate sleeping areas, both cells and dormitories:
occupancy, size, activities, equipment,
psychological needs, and security and privacy 
Occupancy
Issue: The occupancy of sleeping areas in a
facility is determined by the agency’s philosophy
and approach to surveillance/supervision; by
inmate behavior, classification, and custody levels;
and by construction costs 
Response: Perhaps the most significant decision
regarding the design and operation of a
new jail is that of sleeping area occupancy 
This choice measurably affects initial construction
costs and significantly affects longterm
operations and staffingThe options
available to a jurisdiction generally include
single-occupancy cells, double-occupancy
cells, and multiple-occupancy cells (three or
more inmates) 
 
C h a p t e r :
G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
The word “cell” has classically been applied to
inmate sleeping areas of one to eight beds that
are separate from an inmate dayroom in which
showers, dining/recreation tables, and TVs are
locatedThe word “dormitory” is generally applied
when sleeping and dayroom functions are
merged together or when the sleeping room occupancy
reaches nine or more, even if there is an
adjacent dayroom 
The principal argument for using doubleor
multiple-occupancy cells is construction cost
savingsThe arguments against them, as compared
with single-occupancy cells, are as follows:
 Less ability to ensure inmate safety from
physical or sexual assault 
 Inability to isolate inmates during fights or
disturbances 
 Greater demand for maintaining a constant
staff presence during sleeping hours, whereas
with single-occupancy cells, inmates can be
locked down at night and checked intermittently
by roving staff 
 More difficulty in protecting inmate property
from theft 
 Less accountability for cell/dormitory damage
and vandalism 
 Elimination of an inmate’s principal source of
privacy 
The debate over singleversus multipleoccupancy
cells most typically occurs when
making housing design decisions for the general
inmate populationThis is because most of the
special housing populations discussed in 
 are more clearly either single-occupancy
candidates (disciplinary detention, medical isolation)
or multiple-occupancy candidates (inmate
worker, work-release inmate) 
The challenge to most jurisdictions is to determine
whether initial cost advantages during construction
justify potentially greater operational
and staff cost challenges over the operational
life of the buildingFor more on this subject, see
 , “Single Versus Multiple Occupancy,”
in section 
Size
Issue: Sleeping area size is shaped by
activities, equipment, and individual needs 
Response: American Correctional Association
(ACA) standards and some state standards
require a minimum square footage for
sleeping areasThese requirements are not
uniform and often vary according to the occupancy
level of the sleeping areaSleeping
area size is also influenced by the amount
of time an inmate is confined to the area per
dayCell size should be based on the activities
to occur in the cell and the type of furnishings
and equipment selected for use 
Activities
Activities that might influence cell size include
the following:
 Sleeping 
 Reading and writing 
 Grooming 
 Storing personal belongings and toiletries 
 Using the toilet 
 Doing limited calisthenics (e g , pushups,
situps) 
 Eating (not recommended for general population
cells) 
Equipment
Equipment options that can influence cell size
include:
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Bed sizeBeds sufficient in length and width
to accommodate taller, heavier people may
dictate special designs that exceed the approximate
dimensions of the standard detention
bunk (approximatelybyinches) 
 Bed arrangementBunk beds used in multipleoccupancy
settings demand less floor area
than separate beds 
 Desk surfaceMinimal desk surfaces, as offered
by detention equipment manufacturers,
provide approximately to square feetIf
more desk surface area is needed, a fabricated
surface may provide more square footage and
thus require more area in the cellSmaller detention
desks with angular wall supports are
not recommended if the angle interferes with
desk use 
 SeatingDesks are frequently accompanied
by a fixed or moveable stool or chairIf fixed,
an established area of the floor is committed 
Swing-out stools are available on some detention
desks, and some designs allow the bunk
to serve as the seat 
 StorageStorage for toiletries, books, paper,
pens, pictures, clothing, and so forth is essential
to maintaining a neat and sanitary cell
environmentShelves and collapsible hooks
create no special space demand, whereas lockers
or storage drawers do demand floor area 
 Plumbing fixturesA toilet and sink occupy
square footageBesides the possibility of a
pipe chase intrusion (which is typically outside
of cell square footage requirements as
defined by standards), the key space-defining
issue is whether a combination toilet/sink or
more normal, but space-occupying, separate
fixtures will be used (exhibit ) 
Providing a partial-height privacy wall or splash
screen between the fixtures and the bed may also
require slightly more space 
Showers are typically not placed in general population
cells because of expense, sanitation complications,
and securityConsequently, no space
is typically needed for showers 
Psychological needs
Psychological needs involve the sense of confinement
created by the cell space in particular 
These concerns and the need for more space as
compensation can be minimized by:
 “Extending” the sense of space through the
use of sizable cell windows in the face of the
cell (without sacrificing minimum privacy or
security) 
 Using ceiling heights moderately higher than
the typical feet, which also has the advantage
of allowing ceiling sprinklers and light
fixtures to be placed at less accessible heights,
thus reducing the potential for vandalism 
 Avoiding unusually narrow cells that disproportionately
accentuate room length 
 Using light colors for walls and ceiling 
Security and privacy
Issue: Regardless of the classification of inmates,
all sleeping areas must be designed with
security in mind

G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
Response: Cells and dormitories are places
where inmates spend a significant portion
of their dayThey are frequently located
on exterior walls at points in the housing
unit farthest from view (as in the case of
remote observation or direct supervision)
or even out of the view of staff standing in
or moving through adjacent corridors (as
in the case of traditional linear intermittent
surveillance)Consequently, cells and
dormitories provide the best opportunities
for escape attempts, vandalism, suicide attempts,
and/or contraband passageA variety
of considerations can help minimize
these problems:
 Paying particular attention to the
security design of the sleeping area
exterior window, if used(The topic
of security glass is addressed further
in, “Renovating Nonsecure
Buildings Into Jails,” in section )
 Ensuring that the exterior wall is of
secure construction, if the cell is on
an exterior wallIf a concrete masonry
unit wall is used, the wall should be
reinforced and grouted 
 Using sturdy and vandal-resistant
materials within cellsSuch materials
as concrete or vinyl tile on concrete
floors, concrete masonry units for
walls, and concrete or cement plaster
for ceilings are appropriateHowever,
security in this instance does not
imply that the space need be dark
or grimModular concrete and steel
cells are constructed of secure materials
(although issues of poor acoustics
must be considered) 
 Securely fastening in place all miscellaneous
equipment and hardware
in the cell or dormitory (e g , outlet
covers, intercom covers, vent grills,
mirrors, shelves, clothing hooks, door
stops) 
 Minimizing the size of vent grills
and using a security grill that makes
it difficult to tie a string or string-like
object through the grill to attempt
suicide 
 Avoiding joints and gaps that can be
used to hide contraband in places that
cannot be easily checked by staff 
 Minimizing, to the greatest degree
possible, the potential for suicide in
the selection and design of furniture
and equipment 
Issue: A balance must be struck between inmate
privacy in the single-occupancy cell and
the need to observe the cell 
Response: A key element of guaranteeing
a degree of modesty is to create singleoccupancy
cellsSingle-occupancy cells (in
association with a dayroom to prevent isolation)
tend to enhance rather than diminish
security, as has been noted above 
The primary conflict between privacy and security
comes in deciding how much of the face of
the cell to expose to the dayroom and thereby to
staff in the adjacent corridor or control position
(exhibit )The options range from precluding
any view of the cell to opening up the entire face
of the cell (the classic approach to cell design) 
However, if any balance between modesty and
security is to be attained, the proper approach
falls somewhere in between 
The main privacy concern that guides the choice
of cell front design is exposure of the inmate
using the toilet to both inmates and staff passing
the cell, particularly those of the opposite sex 
 
 :

Cell fronts with large windowsNote that the bottom half of the windows
are frosted for privacy in the cell 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )
This is a special problem in cells designed with
fixtures toward the front of the cell, where they
cannot be internally screenedLocating the toilet
at the rear of the cell has an advantage in this
regard because partial-height screens (about 
inches high) can provide minimal privacy while
allowing a view capability and a more liberal
opening of the cell face 
Two other cell modesty concerns involve minimizing
inmate exposure while sleeping and
dressingRelated to those concerns is a simple
environmental concern of minimizing the transference
of light between the dayroom and cells
during evening and sleeping hours 
Regarding security, the issue of needed exposure
depends on the classification of the inmates involved
and on the method used for observing
and managing the inmates while they are in their
cellsStaff should frequently enter the housing
unit to closely examine the cells and check on
the welfare of the inmates in the cellsIn this
E x h i b i t Options for Exposure of the Face
of the Cell

case, exposure of the cell interior to remote view
becomes far less critical 
One additional modesty concern involves the
(indecent) exposure of inmates through exterior
cell or housing area windowsBesides the view
conflicts involved from the public’s side, the inmates’
modesty is infringed when the public can
readily see into cells from the street or adjacent
buildings 
Issue: Some semblance of modesty should be
achieved in multiple-occupancy settings 
Response: The very nature of multipleoccupancy
housing precludes fundamental
modesty in these settingsHowever, minimal
levels of privacy can be obtained by
providing:
 A modesty or splash screen between
toilet areas and the bed and desk areas
of the cell or dorm 
 Privacy partitioning that creates small
groups of beds (two to four) in large
dormitory settings 
 Separate shelving or lockable storage
compartments for each inmate 
 Study or reading carrels or alcoves in
adjacent dayrooms

G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
Dayroom Design Issues
The functional-architectural issues that apply to
dayroom areas—the central activity areas around
which a group of cells is clustered to create a cohesive
housing unit—are location and size 
Location
Issue: Dayrooms should be located to ensure
ease of inmate access and to preserve separation
capabilities 
Response: Dayrooms should be located adjacent
to and immediately accessible from
the cells or dormitories they serveThere
should be one dayroom for each group of
cellsSuch design minimizes inmate movement
and eliminates the security problems
posed by the shared use of a dayroom by
different classifications of inmates and by
dayrooms separated from the housing units 
Size
Issue: The size of dayrooms is dictated by the
activities to occur there, functionality, and aesthetic
concerns for proportion 
Response: ACA standards require that dayrooms
provide certain square footagesMost
often, these square footages are based on
the number of beds in the housing unit
served by the dayroomIn some standards,
the square footage is defined by the maximum
number of inmates using the dayroom
at one timeIn the latter case, decreasing
the dayroom square footage by reducing the
number of inmates allowed access to the
dayroom at one time may be offset by increasing
the cell size requirements, because
inmates are confined there for a greater part
of the day 
In small housing units, typical dayroom square
footage requirements can result in little more
than a narrowto-foot corridor along the
front of the cellsIn most cases, this is not satisfactory,
given the kinds of activities desired for
this space; the simple functionality of moving
through, living in, and working in the space; and
the desire for a well-proportioned room 
The actual size of a dayroom should depend on a
variety of practical design considerationsActivities
that might occur in the dayroom and therefore
help define its size requirements include:
 Eating meals and snacking 
 Reading and writing 
 Conversing 
 TV watching 
 Telephoning 
 Exercising (e g , calisthenics, weights) 
 Engaging in passive recreation (e g , table
games) 
Some activities that take place as part of the
overall housing unit should not occur in the
dayroom unless all inmates in the housing unit
are involved in the activity (e g , counseling,
religious services, and other group program activities) 
Some of the more personal individual
activities, such as visiting, individual counseling,
and medical checkups, should not occur in the
dayroom unless the housing area has been designed
with dedicated space for those functions
(e g , medical exam room, multipurpose room, or
counseling office) 
Tables and seating provided for inmates are another
key determinant of dayroom sizeMost
standards, and good practice, require sufficient
tables and seating to accommodate every inmate
housed in the unit, including those who are
wheelchair boundThis is particularly critical
if dining occurs in the dayroomAdditionally,
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
sufficient space to move around the tables and
seating to gain access to exits, cells, and activity
areas is crucial 
The question of table placement becomes more
critical when two-tier housing units are created 
One of the basic ideas behind two-tier units is
to reduce the need for excess dayroom space 
However, in a housing unit with limited capacity,
the intrusion of the stairs to the second tier can
unacceptably diminish the workability of the dayroom
layout (exhibit )This is truer when a
security vestibule and a shower area also intrude
into the dayroom 
Another size consideration concerns temporary
activities that occur in the dayroomOne
example would be the extra space needed at meal
time for food carts, trays, and meal distribution
in each dayroom 
Pieces of equipment (e g , TVs, telephones, service
counters) and their placement also influence
the size of the dayroomSome of these items
need to be separated from each other and from
other functions in the dayroomFor example,
telephones should be located as far as possible
from the TV and other noise sources, and TVs
should be positioned to provide proper viewing
anglesTo achieve this, the TV cannot be placed
too high on the wall, and there should be some
distance between it and the nearest tableHowever,
TVs should not be placed so low that they
obstruct movement or officer view of the area

Miscellaneous Furniture and Equipment
Issue: Miscellaneous furniture and equipment
should be identified for proper placement in the
dayrooms 
Response: Besides the tables and chairs
used by inmates and major items such as
TVs and telephones, several other types of
equipment must be accommodated in the
dayroom:
 Officer’s work area, in direct supervision
housing units 
 Waste containers 
 Bulletin boards for notices and
information 
 Intercoms for communication with
staff in remote surveillance housing 
 CCTV cameras, as appropriate 
 Recreational equipment 
 Library carts 
Inmates With Disabilities
Issue: The needs of nonambulatory, wheelchairbound
inmates must be accommodated in housing
units 
Response: If the facility is to hold nonambulatory,
wheelchair-bound inmates, certain
special requirements must be met in their
housing units and throughout the facility 
Inmates with disabilities share all of the behavioral
and custodial characteristics of other
inmates, and housing units must be designed to
accommodate them at different custody levels 
 
C h a p t e r :

by inmates with disabilities 
(Photograph courtesy of Liebert & Associates )
The law prohibits housing inmates with disabilities
according to their disability alone, for example,
in a housing unit designed to accommodate
all inmates with disabilities or an isolated “disabled
cell ” This is a significant consideration because
it means that most, if not all, housing units
must be designed to accommodate the needs of
those with disabilitiesThis is true even if the
number of such inmates detained in the course of
a week, month, or even a year, is quite low 
The most common housing area design challenge
comes with respect to inmates confined to
wheelchairsLocal, state, and federal codes and
standards in this regard must be researched prior
to designSpecial design considerations include
the following:
 All doors leading to the housing area and
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-
compliant cells must be wide enough to allow
the passage of a wheelchairAdditionally, sufficient
room must be allowed on the latch side
 If staff are not in a position to assist the inmate,
door closers should not be set at a tension
level that makes opening by the disabled
inmate difficult 
 Toilet and sink fixtures in the cell should be
separate fixtures that accommodate the needs
of the disabled inmate or specially designed
combination fixturesGrab bars or a means
by which the inmate can access toilet fixtures
should be providedIf grab bars are used, consider
making them demountable using special
tools so they do not pose a security problem
with inmates without disabilities who might
use the cellGrab bar design should preclude
suicide attempts 
 Central shower areas and toilet areas should
be accessible to inmates with disabilities 
 Cell desks and a position at the dayroom
tables should be accessible to the inmates with
disabilitiesThis implies that the use of a fixed
stool may be inappropriate in the cell and that
at least one position at the dayroom tables
should be either a moveable chair or a swingout
security seat (exhibit -) 
of doors, especially when they swing toward
the user, to allow access, opening, and maneuvering
room

 Features in the dayroom or housing area,
such as intercoms, telephones, and
drinking fountains, should be accessible
to a wheelchair-bound inmate 
 Ramps at points of entry/egress to the building
should be considered (e g , main entry, sallyport,
exercise areas) 
 All program and service areas should be accessible
to inmates with disabilities 
Issue: Forms of disability other than being nonambulatory
and wheelchair bound must be
accommodated 
Response: When most people think of inmates
with disabilities, they think exclusively
of people who are wheelchair bound 
The ADA, however, identifies many other
conditions that are considered disabilities,
and these should be considered in the design
and operation of new jail facilitiesTwo
examples of disabilities with an impact on
facility development are auditory and visual
impairments 
Auditory impairments
Many modern jails rely on auditory-based electronic
communications (intercoms, public address
systems, telephone visiting, fire alarms,
television monitors)Communication with
hearing-impaired inmates can be lost unless
special steps are taken in the selection of equipment
and/or establishment of operational policy
intended to provide equal access to hearingimpaired
inmatesSeveral physical plant features
can be incorporated that respond to daily and life
safety needs in housing areas:
 Telecommunications Device for the Deaf
(TDD)-style telephones for telephone calls and
telephone visiting, such as video visiting, in
most, if not all, dayrooms 
 Fire alarm systems with visual effects (e g ,
flashing lights), as well as audio systems that
can be “felt” through sonic vibrations 
 TV monitors with closed caption capabilities 
 Orientation tapes that convey facility rules
through presenters who sign, as well as with
closed captioning 
 Electronic message boards within view of cells
and dayrooms that can be used to convey routine
messages (e g , visiting hours) as well as
information usually expressed orally 
Visual impairments
Facility development considerations with respect
to inmates with visual impairments are:
 Braille signage on cell doors and throughout
the facility 
 Posted Braille version of key facility rules and
policies 
 Cell and especially dayroom areas sufficiently
spacious to allow easy, clear paths of travel
around furniture and equipment and to emergency
egress routes 
 Issuance of canes approved by facility
administration 
 Location of cells designed for those with disabilities
near shower/toilet areas and egress
routes 
Staff Control Post Design
The following issues pertain to staff posts that
observe or supervise housing units: post size,
staff activities, and mode of surveillance/
supervision; shape of post; security; and
communications 
Size, activities, surveillance/supervision mode
Issue: The size of staff control posts depends on
staff activities and the surveillance/supervision
mode used 
 
C h a p t e r :
G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
Response: Staff members in charge of observing
and supervising housing units have
a variety of responsibilities, which typically
include the following:
 Observing and supervising inmates 
 Report writing 
 Recordkeeping, activity logging 
 Storing and maintaining manuals,
directories, and similar materials 
 Responding to inmate complaints and
needs 
 Communicating with other staff in the
facility via intercoms or telephones 
 Observing and controlling activities
in and around the housing units
(e g , food service, laundry pickup,
counseling, movement to court or visiting,
maintenance) 
 Monitoring alarms and other security
systems 
 Responding to emergency situations 
 Controlling doors, lights, heat, ventilation,
communications, and/or security
systems within the housing unit 
 Managing the supply needs of the
housing unit 
Direct supervisionIn direct supervision, an officer
workstation can vary from a desk with a
computer and file cabinet placed in a dormitory
to an elevated workstation with door, light, and
other controls in a two-tiered housing unitThe
control post work area should provide space for a
computer, paperwork, books, manuals, and miscellaneous
items needed by the officerIt should
also have lockable drawers and filesStaff toilet
areas will be located in a separate space 
Remote observationThe staff posts in a remote
observation setting are frequently the largest, particularly
when they are enclosedThis is because
the staff space must function as a self-contained
operationWithin the post must be all of the control
panels used to manage locks, lights, alarm
systems, and so forth, plus room for records and
files, and work surfaces for report writing and
equipment (telephones, intercoms, computers) 
When the control post is fully enclosed, it often
has toilet facilities for staff accessible from within
the control space 
Open-counter remote observation posts (see photograph
on page) tend to require less square
footage because toilet facilities are not required
within the post itselfHowever, remote observation
control posts are frequently more spacious
than necessary (exhibit -), given the need
for a strategic location that provides staff with a
view into a variety of surrounding housing units
or activity areasEven though the post may be
larger than truly necessary, the additional space
should not go unusedWithin the remote surveillance
space can be a variety of undercounter

storage areas that help solve some of the chronic
problems of insufficient storage in jails 
It is important to realize that although the size of
a remote surveillance control post may be larger
than necessary, there is generally only one point
in that space from which the officer typically
worksThat is, there is only one point where the
officer’s equipment for controlling locks, lights,
and so forth will be locatedTherefore, even if
the size and arrangement of the control post tend
to suggest that total view control is obtained, the
true location from which the officer will operate
the controls must be pinpointed with regard to
the sufficiency of the views and then considered
from that point 
Intermittent surveillanceWith intermittently
monitored facilities, the size of the staff post can
be restricted to its basic needs because the design
of the post is not, by concept, influenced by a
need to create any specific physical or view relationship
with the housing unitsIts space requirements
are shaped by its need for a desk surface
for computer monitors or control panels and
report writing, record storage, and storage
of miscellaneous equipment, paperwork, and
supplies 
Shape of post
Issue: Space or area size can be dictated by the
shape of the control post 
Response: It is recommended that the actual
casework required for controls be shaped to
allow convenient use from a single point 
This tends to dictate against long, straight
counter tops and suggests work areas that
are more or less “in-the-round” so that staff
can easily reach all of the equipment and
surfaces they need without a lot of chair or
body movement 
Security
Issue: Clear lines of responsibility must be determined
between housing unit control responsibilities
and interrelationships and master control
responsibilities and interrelationships 
Response: It is important to determine the
control responsibilities allocated to the
housing unit officers to ensure that work
loads are manageableAlso, it is critical to
determine the degree to which the housing
unit officers’ controls are duplicated and
can be overridden by master control 
The following types of functions may come
under the direct control of the housing unit
control officer:
 Individual cell locks and door status 
 Dayroom door locks and status 
Elevated officer’s workstation in a direct supervision housing unitThe
elevated area allows the officer to observe both the first floor and second
tier from the station

C h a p t e r :
G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
 Doors to various program and service areas
within a cluster of housing units or directly

 Cell, dayroom, associated program areas,
corridor, and control position lights 
 Inmate telephones 
 Recreational TV channel and sound controls 
 CCTV monitors within the housing areas 
 Intercoms between the cells, dayroom, program
areas, corridors, and other staff posts
and the control position 
 Alarm systems 
It is also critical to the design of the staff post,
and the housing area as a whole, to decide
whether the officer will merely observe or
physically participate in typical housing area activities
such as:
 Distribution of meals 
 Pickup and distribution of laundry 
 Removal of waste and garbage 
 Receipt of sick call and commissary slips 
 Receipt and distribution of mail 
 Escort of inmates to and from their cells, either
within the perimeter of the housing area or
throughout the jail 
 Routine cleaning activities 
The choice of observer or participant role directly
affects the design of remote observation control
postsIf the officer is to be a participant, an open
staff post would probably be needed, as opposed
to a fully enclosed postThe officer’s role would
not similarly affect direct supervision situations
because the officer is a direct participant in all
housing unit activities, does not leave the housing
unit, and is not ever in an enclosed control
postNor would it affect intermittent surveillance
situations because officer movement and, thus,
some degree of interaction with inmates is inherent
in the concept 
If a remote method of observation is selected and
the officer is to participate in activities beyond
those that can be controlled electronically from
within the staff post, the resulting open-counter
position presents some security problems that
must be addressed:
 The officer must have the ability to turn off the
controls when he/she leaves the station, and
there must be master control backup override
in the event of an emergencyThis is also true
for control posts in direct supervision, where
the officer has control of locks, lights, and
other equipment in the housing unit 
 The entire housing area (and all of its individual
housing units) has to be treated as a
perimeter, the exit from which is controlled
by master control rather than by the housing
Officer’s workstation in a high-security housing area

 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
control officerThis is done to limit the value
of assaulting the officer and gaining control
over the open-counter position 
Issue: It is critical for the housing control officer
to have a maximized view of the housing area(s) 
Response: Virtually every area in a housing
unit must be visible to the officer as he/
she either monitors the area from a fixed
control post or moves through the housing
areaAlthough this does not mean that a
full view of the interior of every space (e g ,
inmate cells) is necessary, it does mean that
the officer should have a full view of at least
the dayroom and the points of access to all
areas within the housing unit (e g , cells,
shower areas, vestibules, visiting areas, exercise
areas) 
If a two-tier housing unit area is designed, it is
critical to ensure that staff have a vertical view
angle that allows adequate view of second-tier
activitiesThe details of the design should accommodate
view as discussed earlier in this
 under “Basic Design Issues ”
The view provided through dayroom windows
and vestibules is a key considerationIf the view
angle is severe enough, especially between a
fixed staff post and a housing unit, the relatively
deep and thick framing used with security glazing
may create more of an obstacle to the view
than anticipated 
The actual view obtained through vestibules
may also be much less than expected because of
the interference created by the framing for glazing,
the wide door frames created when jambmounted
locks are used, and the width of the
door panel, even when the upper portion of the
door is glazedSingle-level vestibules can obscure
vertical views in a two-tier housing
unit (exhibit -)When two-tier spaces are
involved, it is also important to take into account
the amount of visual interference created by
sliding door mechanismsThese mechanisms
typically are placed above the doors and can
be relatively deep, thereby blocking view into
second-tier areas from adjacent control positions 
The lower-level views of dayrooms are also important
to considerMany designs have concrete
masonry construction of five courses of block (
inches) at the base of the dayroom wallsThis
can provide a hiding area for inmatesThe designer
may want to consider taking the glazing at
the front of the dayrooms down to a oneor twocourse
level

Communications
Issue: The staff control posts must be provided
with proper communication capabilities 
Response: In remote observation, it is important
for control officers to be in a position
that allows them to communicate
properly with inmates under their control
and with other staff in the facilityCommunication
with the inmate population is
fundamental to meeting inmate needsThis
is not a design issue in direct supervision
because the officer is in the unit with the
inmates 
An inmate-to-officer communication system
should provide the inmate with the ability to
 
C h a p t e r :
G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
communicate at will from both individual cells
and the dayroom to the staff in both the corridor
and the control postWith the use of solid materials
in construction (e g , concrete masonry
units, concrete, security glass), communication
is typically achieved through an intercom and/or
mechanical talk-through communication device 
To provide privacy in dayroom-to-staff communications,
a telephone might be considered in
addition to the outside telephone lines that allow
inmates to talk with friends and relatives 
To facilitate more normal levels of conversation
between inmates in the dayroom and officers in
the corridor, the designer might consider placing
a passthrough or opening in the dayroom wall
at approximately shoulder/mouth heightIt is
also important to provide a means by which
staff in enclosed control posts can communicate
with, and pass things to, officers outside the
control post 
Miscellaneous Design Issues
The following functional-architectural issues deal
with miscellaneous space and design considerations
relative to the general housing areas: security
vestibule, showers, storage, janitor closet,
multipurpose rooms, and visiting areas 
Security vestibule
Issue: Identify the need for a security vestibule
entry to housing units 
Response: The primary objectives in providing
a security vestibule are to prevent unauthorized
inmates from leaving the housing
unit and to eliminate the danger of several
inmates rushing an open dayroom door
in an escape attemptAlso, during inmate
disturbances, the vestibule provides added
control and containment capabilitiesHowever,
the security vestibule also represents
an additional barrier to manipulate, can diminish
remote views, and can add construction
costs to a project 
The key to determining the need for a security
vestibule is identifying the security risk presented
by the inmates housed in a particular housing
area, considering the consequences to security
if inmates escape their housing unit, and understanding
the housing area’s relationship to the security
perimeter and zoning concepts of the jail 
It is typical to assume that a low-security general
population would be less likely to require a security
vestibule leading into the spaceHowever,
such a vestibule may be deemed essential when
a high-risk group is involved 
The need for a security vestibule is greatly reduced
when a constantly staffed, fully enclosed,
securely constructed post is located immediately
adjacent to the housing unitsIf a housing area
or pod consisting of several housing units is
clearly defined as a security zone in which escape
from a dayroom leads only to a limited,
sealed-off housing area corridor, the need for vestibules
may be eliminatedIn this case, the corridor
functions as one large housing area vestibule 
Such an approach is especially valid when the
exit from the housing area corridor is controlled
by staff outside the housing areas, such as master
controlHowever, vestibules should still be considered
for use with high-risk inmates 
When a security vestibule is provided, it is important
that all vestibule doors be interlocked 
That is, the controls of the doors must be set up
so that when one door is opened, the other(s)
cannot be openedHowever, such an interlock
system should have an override capability so that
all doors or selected sets of doors can be opened
simultaneously if emergency egress or ingress is
required 
In sizing a security vestibule, it is important to
ensure that it is large enough to accommodate
both the maximum number of people to be
moved at one time and the equipment that might
be moved through the space (e g , food carts;
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
laundry carts; emergency medical equipment
such as crash carts, gurneys, and stretchers) 
The security vestibule should also be designed to
meet access requirements for wheelchair-bound
inmates or staff 
Sizing must take into account that interlocking
doors limit maneuverability, especially if swinging
doors are usedSwinging doors should swing
out, away from the housing unit, to facilitate
emergency egress and prevent inmates from barricading
themselves inside the dayroomThe
actual path of travel for equipment must also be
considered in concert with door swings (exhibit
-), especially in situations where doors are
located in walls perpendicular to each other rather
than parallel to each other

Showers
Issue: Showers or bath areas must be provided
in association with each housing unit 
Response: Shower areas are typically provided
on the ratio of shower for every
 – inmates in general population areas,
depending on applicable standardsShowers
are typically provided instead of bath facilities 
Bathtubs are most commonly found in
medical housing and are used for treatment
purposes 
Shower areas can be constructed of concrete masonry
walls treated with special water-resistant
and durable coatings and premanufactured
shower pans and floorsThey can also be stainless
steel cabinet units as supplied by detention
equipment manufacturers, either free standing or
installed in a recessed alcove designed for that
purposeIn either case, the showers should use
detention-quality fixtures designed to take inmate
abuse and preclude suicide attempts by eliminating
protrusions from which an inmate can hang
him/herself 
Regardless of the shower type used, it is important
to include a small drying and dressing area
or alcove just outside the shower area and ways
to contain drips and spills from the shower area 
A nonslip surface should be applied to the floor
immediately adjacent to the shower area, and
curbing can help contain excess water(In ADAcompliant
shower areas, the curbing must have a
sufficiently low profile that wheelchairs can pass
over it easily )

C h a p t e r :
G e n e r a l H o u s i n g
A key design problem with shower areas is striking
the proper balance between the modesty
required by the inmate and the needs of staff to
observe the areaIt is recommended that staff at
least be able to see the entry to the shower area,
and that the entry and shower area not be fully
exposed to the dayroom and other inmatesUse
of security glass block side walls can aid in developing
some visibility without totally sacrificing
modestyShower curtains, doors, or screens
should at least allow a head-and-shoulder view
of the inmate and, preferably, a foot-and-ankle
view as wellIt is useful to provide a capability
for hanging towels and clothing adjacent to the
shower area 
Proper ventilation of the shower area is also
important to prevent moisture and odors from
spreading to adjacent dayroom areas and to prevent
mildew from building up in the shower area 
Storage
Issue: Housing areas require adequate storage
adjacent to or within the area 
Response: It is important that storage capabilities
be provided to service the housing
areasThese storage capabilities are not
meant to supplant central storerooms, but
to allow a convenient way to respond to
the daily needs of inmatesSuch localized
storage areas might contain extra linens,
spare mattresses, toiletries, paper products,
forms, recreation equipment such as cards
and games, and other commonly used supplies 
In direct supervision housing units, it
is particularly useful to have storage space
located within the unit 
Janitor closets
Issue: Maintenance of the housing units can
be facilitated by providing a janitor closet in
the area 
Response: A small janitor closet with a floor
sink, mops, buckets, cleaning supplies,
floor buffers, and so forth can be a great
benefit to the maintenance program of the
facilityConvenient location in the housing
area promotes the use of the equipment
by inmatesThe janitor closet should have
shelves for the storage of cleaning supplies,
a splash basin, and a hose and hose bib that
can be used to wash down areas as necessary 
It should be equipped with a smoke
detector because of the presence of cleaning
fluids and should be a lockable space controlled
only by staffIn two-tiered housing
areas, a janitor’s closet should be located
on each tier so inmates are not required to
carry heavy cleaning equipment and full
mop buckets up a flight of stairs 
Multipurpose rooms
Issue: To keep the movement of inmates within
the facility to a minimum, it is desirable to provide
multipurpose room(s) in general population
housing units 
Response: The concept of bringing services
to inmates rather than taking inmates to
services became popular with the advent of
direct supervisionAs a result, jurisdictions
have found it desirable to include a multipurpose
space in general population housing
unitsThese rooms are generally located
off of the main dayroom and can be used
for purposes such as small classes, counseling,
medication distribution, and haircuts 
Using space in the housing area to provide
services reduces the amount of inmate
movement within the facility and reduces
staff time devoted to moving inmatesSmall
multipurpose rooms in the housing areas
generally will not eliminate the need for
larger multipurpose rooms and classrooms
designed to hold larger groups from different
housing areas 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Visiting areas
Issue: Visiting areas adjacent to or inside the
housing area can reduce staff time, movement,
and scheduling difficulties associated with centralized
visiting 
Response: Providing inmates with access
to visits with family and friends, either
through noncontact visiting booths connected
to the housing area or through the use
of video visitation, can greatly reduce the
number of facility staff devoted to the visiting
functionThe housing officer would be
responsible for monitoring visiting as part of
his/her regular duties, eliminating the need
for a visiting officer or a movement officer
to escort the inmates back and forth to the
visiting areaVisiting areas adjacent to or
inside housing areas can also expand the
time allocated for visits and the number of
visits an inmate can receive in a week because
an additional officer is not required to
supervise the activity 
Space List
Some of the typical spaces that might be found
within the general housing component include:
 Cells or dormitories 
 Dayrooms (one per housing unit) 
 Security vestibules (as needed) 
 Shower area (per– inmates, per code) 
 Dayroom inmate toilet area 
 Storage 
 Janitor closet 
 Staff control post (one per housing area
recommended) 
Video visitation area in the dayroom of a housing area 
(Photograph courtesy of Liebert & Associates )
 Staff toilet (one per staff post) 
 Multipurpose room 
 Visiting area 
Local codes and ADA guidelines regarding accessibility
requirements should be consulted when
planning these spaces 
Some spaces that might be associated with general
housing, depending on operational programming,
movement, and surveillance concepts,
include:
 Indoor and/or outdoor exercise 
 Sick call/medical exam room 
 Video court appearance room 
 Food reheating/distribution area

Special Housing
The special housing areas of a jail accommodate
all male or female inmates who by
behavior, condition, or unique security risk
require spaces with special design characteristics
and/or spaces separate from those used by the
general populationInmate groups for whom
special housing is described in this functionalarchitectural
component include the following:
 Work release/periodic-sentence inmates, who
are regularly released from and readmitted to
the jail to go to a job or school during the time
they are serving a sentence or being detained
prior to trial 
 Inmate workers, who are given work assignments
within the facility and outside of their
housing unit (e g , kitchen or laundry duty
and/or general facility maintenance) or outside
the facility on supervised work crews providing
services to the jurisdiction (e g , road
cleanup, landscaping) 
 Protective custody inmates, who need protection
or separation from the rest of the inmate
population but do not pose a threat to others
or themselves 
 Juveniles detained as adults, who are typically
to -year-olds who are to be tried as adults
because of the nature of the crime with which
they are charged(Local and state laws and the
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
(JJDP) Act should be consulted to determine the
definition of “juvenile” and criteria regarding
assignment of “adult” status in criminal proceedings,
as this varies widely from state to state )
 Medically isolated inmates, who must be
separated from others because of their medical
status, because they are infected with a
communicable disease, or because they have a
health condition that requires the supervision
of medical staff or separation from the general
population 
 Inmates serving disciplinary time, who can be
separated from the general population as punishment
for serious rule violations 
 High-security inmates, who pose a verifiable
threat to staff and other inmates (sometimes
referred to as “administrative segregation”) 
 Suicidal inmates, who have already attempted
suicide or have suicidal tendencies so apparent
that they need special observation and protection 
They do not necessarily include inmates
who may have suicidal tendencies but can be
detained in a general housing unit that is observed
in a constant manner 
 Inmates with mental disabilities, who are
known to have serious mental health problems
or who demonstrate sufficiently abnormal
behavior to merit special observationThis
category can also refer to inmates with developmental
disabilities who may be victimized
in the general population 
 Intoxicated inmates who are under the influence
of alcohol or drugs 
 Inmates with physical disabilities who require
special design accommodationsThese inmates
can be found in any of the special housing
categories, but do not constitute a group
for whom a special unit is createdDesigns of
special housing areas, therefore, must accommodate
the needs of inmates with physical disabilities
as wellMore information on design
considerations for these inmates is provided in
 , “General Housing ”
These special categories of inmates
pose separation and management
problems in all jails, but those
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
problems are more acute in small jailsSome of
these categories of inmates require significantly
different types of space and/or different levels of
separation and observation than do inmates in
general population housingHistorically, small
jails have had inadequate space and observation
capabilities to satisfactorily accommodate these
various groups, resulting in serious operational
or legal problems 
One option in planning and design in smaller
jails is to seek alternative housing for special inmates 
Removing them from the small jail is beneficial
to the efficient development of space and
the management of operational problems facing
the limited staff and resources of the smaller jail 
If some or all special categories of inmates must
be accommodated at the small jail, the emphasis
must be on designing space flexibly so that the
limited number of beds available can accommodate
as many different types of inmates as
possible 
Providing for the separate needs of different
types of inmates remains perhaps the greatest
challenge facing jail designersA further challenge
is that standards typically require that
inmates in administrative segregation, protective
custody, disciplinary detention, and other special
forms of housing have the benefit of the same
general conditions and the same access to health
care, exercise, and other services as do general
population inmatesIn other words, occupancy
in a special housing unit does not justify the loss
of fundamental rights, conditions, and privileges 
In reviewing the issues addressed in this
functional-architectural section, readers should
refer to the concepts presented in ,
“Classification/Separation,” and ,
“Surveillance/Supervision,” many of which have
a direct impact on the development of special
housing space 
Key Decisions
The following decisions have a fundamental effect
on design requirements and therefore should
be made when evaluating the role of special
housing:
 Which types of special inmates must be accommodated
at the jail and which can be taken directly
to alternative facilities, such as work release
centers, detoxification centers, or mental health
facilities, or be housed in other jurisdictions?
 What is the average daily population and
maximum length of stay for each type of special
inmate to be accommodated by the new
jail facility? Does your facility have a large
enough special housing population to require
separate housing units for each type, and do
these types of inmates stay, on average, several
hours, overnight, or through adjudication?
(Average daily population and duration of stay
will affect the nature of the space provided
and the nature of the management problem
posed by the groups )
 To what degree can it be assumed that certain
special housing spaces can be shared by different
types of inmates because of the limited frequency
with which such inmates are actually
received at the jail?
 Who will manage and control the activities of
the various special inmate groups? If special
treatment or supervision is required for any
inmate group, who will provide that treatment
and/or supervision?
Detail Issues
The functional-architectural issues discussed in
thisaddress the development of special
housing areas for the following populations:
work release/periodic-sentence inmates, inmate
workers, protective custody, juveniles, inmates
requiring medical isolation, disciplinary
 
C h a p t e r :
S p e c i a l H o u s i n g
detention/administrative segregation inmates,
inmates with mental or developmental disabilities,
those who are suicidal, and those who are
intoxicatedSome classifications of special inmates
are grouped together because the characteristics
of their housing areas are similarThe
areas could be used interchangeably by the different
classifications, assuming, of course, that the
classifications will not be mixed together in actual
practiceAttaining such interchangeability assumes
that the frequency and/or timing of a special
inmate’s admission are appropriately limited

Many of the design considerations for the dayroom
area, cells, and other aspects of the housing
units discussed in, “General Housing,”
also apply to special housingReaders are encouraged
to refer to these s in conjunction
with the current
Work Release/Periodic-Sentence Inmates
Issue: The basic living needs of inmates on work
release and those with periodic sentencesare
similar to those of all inmates and should be
accommodated 
Response: The following characteristics are
appropriate to the physical environment for
work release and periodic-sentence inmates 
 Sleeping areas may be dormitories,
multiple-occupancy cells, or singleoccupancy
cellsWhen dormitories
are used, some provisions should be
made for privacy and property protection 
Privacy can be provided by the
use of partialor full-height partitions
(exhibit ) 
 The sleeping room/area should include
these items:
Bed 
Desk 
Chair or stool 
Light fixture, possibly controllable by
the inmate 
Lockable storage locker or cabinet 
 Dayroom space should be providedIt should
be separate from the sleeping areas, especially
if work release/periodic-sentence inmates
work different shifts and the acoustic privacy
of sleeping inmates would be disturbed by inmates
who may be watching television, talking
on the telephone, showering, or conversing 
 Sufficient shower areas should be provided to
allow work release inmates to expeditiously
get ready for their work dayShowers should
provide a high degree of privacy, although
staff observation from outside the area should
be accommodated through a small vision panel
or through partial-height doorsThe panels
may be shuttered or screened to prevent
unauthorized view 
Periodic-sentence inmates are most commonly those that serve weekends in jail (“weekenders”) and stay at their home during the
work week, although there are other variations 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Whether or not a security vestibule is necessary
as an entry to the housing unit depends
on the agency’s philosophy about work
release/periodic-sentence inmates, the environment,
and the proximity to other areas
of the jailIf located correctly, and if there is
a secure vestibule from the work release/
periodic-sentence inmate housing unit into
the jail, a security vestibule to the exterior
of the building may not be required
 Furniture should be durable, but need not be
security quality or fixed in place 
 A direct line of sight into the sleeping and dayroom
areas is useful, even if observation round
policies require staff to enter both areas periodically
to observe inmates (exhibit ) 
 The housing unit should have a means for inmates
to communicate with staff at a constantly
staffed post and, possibly, in the adjacent
corridorCommunication between inmates in
a housing unit and roving or medical staff may
be accomplished without requiring entry into
the housing unit, although the preferred option
is to provide face-to-face contact whenever
possible 
 Lighting for the dayroom should be controlled
by a switch separate from that for the lighting
Toilet/shower area
Dormitory

Control
E x h i b i t Direct Line of Sight Into Sleeping
and Dayroom Areas
for the sleeping areas because of the separation
of the areas and different schedules 
 Natural light should be introduced to both
sleeping and dayroom areas, but should be
minimized and controllable in the sleeping areas
if work release schedules require sleeping
during daylight hours 
 Additional considerations in housing units occupied
by work release or inmate workers may
include:
Ground fault outlets in the sleeping rooms
or dayrooms for inmate workers to accommodate
radios, televisions, and coffee pots,
if those items are allowed by policy 
Televisions that inmates control in the
dayrooms 
Access to washers and dryers to allow work
release inmates to launder their work clothing
and/or personal clothing 
Security
Issue: Although work release and periodicsentence
inmates are generally considered to
be low-security classification, security is still a
consideration 
Response: Some vital security considerations
that must be addressed are principally directed
toward the prevention of contraband
passage and vandalism in the facility:
 The elements of the internal security
zone that defines the work release
area—principally those elements that
double as the main security envelope
of the building—must be sufficiently
secure to preclude the passage of contraband
into the work release area by
outside parties: secure wall construction,
nonoperable windows, security
glass, and at least two doors between
the area and the outside 
 
C h a p t e r :
S p e c i a l H o u s i n g
 It is not uncommon in larger jail
systems for work release/periodicsentence
inmates to be housed in a
separate facility, either on the same
campus as the main facility or elsewhere 
This separate facility mitigates
the need for increased security beyond
that required for minimum-security
inmates 
 The entry/exit used by work release/
periodic-sentence inmates should be
separate from the entry and exit for
the regular inmate population and the
public, if possible (exhibit )If
not possible, a strictly managed entry/
exit sequence should be implemented
to minimize contact with areas normally
used and occupied by the other
inmates(More information on the
conditions under which the normal
intake-release area can be used is
Lobby for entry into work release housing separate from the main
facility lobby 
(Photograph courtesy of Jim Rowenhorst )
presented in, “Intake-
Release ”)
 There should be an area or areas in
which the incoming work release/
periodic-sentence inmates can be
searched, change clothes, and store
their work clothing (exhibit ) 
This area should accommodate either
a standing metal detection unit or
simply a hand-held metal detectorSobriety
testing equipment is also useful
to test incoming inmates suspected of
intoxication 
 Locker facilities outside the sleeping
area and dayroom should be provided
to secure the valuables, work tools,
backpacks, etcthat inmates are allowed
to possess when leaving the
facilityLockers preclude the problem
of theft 
 The area should be totally separate
from all other housing areas and from

as many of the main traffic corridors
of the facility as possibleIf work
release/periodic-sentence inmates use
program and exercise areas used by
the general inmate population, staff
should take care to ensure that no
contraband has been left by a work
release/periodic-sentence inmate for
other inmates 
 Separate laundry facilities should be
provided to preclude the possibility
that identifiable personal laundry becomes
a vehicle for contraband
passage 
 Some subdivision of the housing area
is appropriate to enhance general control
and security between work release
inmates and periodic-sentence inmates
and/or between inmates released for
different work shifts (e g , ifbeds
are provided overall, the area could be
divided into two -bed areas or three
 -bed areas) 
Bed capacity
Issue: Sufficient capacity should be provided to
accommodate the surges in inmate population
created by weekend sentencing 
Response: Weekend sentencing is used as
an option in many jurisdictions so that the
inmate can work all week at his/her job
and spend only free weekend time in the
jailHowever, weekend sentencing typically
causes problems for the jail, in that it
tends to significantly increase the inmate
population at a time when there is a normal
increase in the number of arrests and jail
bookingsThis surge must be recognized in
planning so that adequate capacity is available
in the work release/periodic-sentence
inmate housing areas and increased intake
and release requirements can be accommodated
without conflicting with other inmate
admissionsIt is common to plan an intake
area in the work release lobby for work release
intakes and weekend admissionsThis
allows these inmates to be processed into
the facility without overwhelming the facility
intake area and reduces the potential for
contraband to enter the main jail facility 
Issue: The male work release population must
be kept separate from the female work release
population 
Response: Women are also sentenced to
work release or periodic staysThe same
levels of separation between male and female
housing areas discussed in 
 , “Classification/Separation,” in section
must be maintained in the work release/
periodic-sentence housing areas: physical,
 
C h a p t e r :
S p e c i a l H o u s i n g
sight, and sound separationThis is particularly
true if the work release/periodicsentence
areas are intermittently monitored,
as is frequently the case 
In addition to the housing areas, search areas
should be private, if not separate, for men and
womenA common entry is appropriate, but a
separate waiting area is desirable if the area cannot
be directly observed and inmates are not immediately
processed by staff 
If the female work release/periodic-sentence inmate
population is very limited in number, the
women might be housed in general housing or
another unit used for sentenced female inmates 
In this case, the contraband passage and property
protection risks must be managed administratively
rather than architecturally 
Inmate Workers
Issue: The basic living needs of inmate workers
must be accommodated 
Response: The inmate worker housing area
has the same characteristics detailed above
for work release/periodic-sentence inmates 
Reference should be made to that information
in developing the inmate worker space 
Issue: Inmate worker housing areas should be
properly located 
Response: Inmate worker housing areas
should be kept separate from the other inmate
housing areas, if possible, consistent
with surveillance needsThey should be
near the functional areas where the inmate
workers perform their daily duties, such
as the laundry and food service areasThe
inmate worker area should also be within
the secure perimeter of the jail because inmate
workers are not normally free to move
outside of the facility unless they are on supervised
work crewsThose inmate workers
who perform tasks outside of the facility are
often housed in work release housing, with
the only difference being that they are picked
up daily for supervised work crews rather
than going to their own job 
It is critical to keep the internal inmate workers
separate from work release/periodic-sentence
inmatesFailure to provide this separation creates
a natural chain of contraband passage from
work release inmate to inmate worker to general
housing inmate, because inmate workers are
frequently in other areas of the facility as part of
their laundry, kitchen, janitorial, or maintenance
duties 
Protective Custody Inmates/Juveniles
The characteristics of housing facilities for inmates
in protective custody and for juveniles
detained as adults can be quite similarThese
two groups are dealt with jointly in this section
because of those similaritiesAdditionally, in
smaller jails, the infrequency of juveniles being
detained as adults and of protective custody inmates
being held could allow this area to be used
interchangeably 
As a rule, the design of the protective custody
unit is fundamentally the same as that of a general
housing unitConsequently, the issues and responses
regarding dayroom and cell space raised
in, “General Housing,” apply 
In larger jail systems, one or more general
population housing units are set aside to house
protective custody inmates, depending on the
population at a given timeHowever, in the
smaller jail, the limited size of the protective
custody group means the number of beds allocated
for protective custody housing could be
accommodated in the kind of “swing” or special
management housing unit discussed in 
 , “Classification/Separation ” Such a swing unit
might be adjacent to the female housing unit or
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
another special housing unit so that it could be
used for an overflow female or special housing
population when not being used for protective
custody 
Housing flexibility
Issue: Flexibility in housing assignments
should be a characteristic of
protective custody housing in the
smaller jail 
Response: The flexibility of small protective
custody or swing housing units can be
increased in various ways, each of which
involves careful detailing and design:
 Develop each individual housing unit
with minimum capacitySpecifically,
restricting each protective custody
housing unit’s capacity provides an
ability to adjust to the varying natures
of the populations to be housed in the
units 
 Provide a door in the dayroom partition
that divides individual units to
allow, for example, two-bed areas
to function as one-bed area when
inmates of identical classifications are

involved (exhibit )This flexibility
also combats the problems inherent
in two-bed areas, namely, a one-onone
inmate situation that is typically
thought to be undesirableIt also prevents
the possibility of isolation when
only one person is in a unit, when
immediately adjacent are two inmates
of the same classification 
 It is important that the door dividing
the two housing units be acoustically
treated and have a security threshold
that limits sound transfer and
precludes the passage of contraband
when inmates of different classifications
are in the adjacent areas 
 Develop a swing cell between two
adjacent housing units that can open
to either of them to easily change the
capacity of either area 
 Provide a second access to one of the
cells so that special housing needs can
be accommodated on those unusual
days when there is a full variety of
inmate types in the facility and too
few separate areas to manage them
(exhibit )In these circumstances,

which are expected to be rare and of
short duration, access to dayrooms
and showers will have to be scheduled
and managed by staff 
If this possibility is to be incorporated into the
design to limit the overall amount of bed space
and still cover all circumstances, the constant
presence of staff is appropriateConsequently, it
is recommended for smaller facilities that when
a housing area is developed as versatile swing,
or special management space, protective custody
areas be remote surveillance areas 
Separation
Issue: Protective custody/swing areas should
be separated from other housing units, and the
units within the protective custody/swing areas
should be separated from each other 
Response: When housing protective custody
inmates, providing the capability of full physical,
sight, and sound separation from the
other general population units is important 
For the swing/special management concept,
it is also important to provide separation between
the various housing units within the
area, because inmates of very different classifications
might be housed in the area at the
same timeIt is imperative for protective custody
areas to be separated from disciplinary
detention and high-security areas, as inmates
in those areas might pose a direct physical,
visual, or verbal threat to inmates who are
being protected 
Issue: Housing juvenile offenders in adult jails
can pose serious design and management
problems 
Response: In , youth younger than 
years of age accounted for percent of jail
inmatesOf those,percent were held as
adults Juveniles pose a major management
and housing problem in jails of all sizes, especially
if law or standards require site and
sound separation at all timesAs with protective
custody inmates, designing space for
juvenile offenders requires full separation
from other general population or special
housing inmates in the facilityGenerally,
juveniles make up a very small portion of
the population in any jail, so it is important
that the jurisdiction use the concept of
swing housing, described above, when planning
for juvenilesAdditionally, in housing
areas for juveniles, the availability of multipurpose
space for educational programming

Medical Isolation and Medical Housing
Jail administrators should refrain from housing
inmates who have long-term and serious medical
problems for any extended period, unless the
facility has designed a special medical housing
unit and has full-time medical staff on duty in
that areaInmates with serious medical problems
present major challenges in terms of providing
proper care and facilitiesThis section discusses
design characteristics, location, and security with
respect to the housing of people suspected of
having, or known to have, diseases or illnesses
that might be contagious/infectious (e g , serious
flu virus, tuberculosis) and those who require
supervision by medical staff while they are being
treated for or are recovering from a medical condition 
It is recommended that new jail facilities
incorporate negative pressure isolation cells in
the design of their medical units to accommodate
inmates with contagious/infectious diseasesIn
small jails that is not always possible, and appropriate
alternative facilities must be identified

for inmates diagnosed with a serious contagious
illness 
In circumstances where only a cold, a minor virus,
or a mild influenza is involved, medical isolation
needs might be accommodated by simply
isolating the inmate in his/her regular cellMore
information on nonhousing health care areas
(e g , examination areas, medication storage) is
given in, “Health Care ”
Characteristics
Issue: Medical housing areas should accommodate
the medical and personal needs of the
inmate 
Response: A medical housing area should
have the following design characteristics:
 It should basically be of high-security
construction because it will likely accommodate
the full range of classifications
served by the jail 
 A dayroom area, which should
accommodate a shower, is desirable
adjacent to medical cellsIf no dayroom
space is available, medical isolation
cells should include a shower
if this practice complies with local
codesAccommodation for television
viewing, telephone access, and a visitation
area are additional considerations,
especially if such amenities are
available to other inmates 
Overhead of medical isolation cells with Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA)-compliant plumbing fixtures, medical bed accessible from three
sides, and adjacent airlock vestibuleShowers are not in the cell 
 Cells should be single occupancy 
 Cells should be located so as to facilitate
frequent observation by medical
personnel and security staff 
 The size of cells should be dictated
by the types of furniture and equipment
within themBesides a possible
shower, it is useful for the bed to be
accessible from more than one side 
An appropriately designed medical
cell frequently exceeds square feet
in size

 The bed should be fixed in place and
comfortableThe use of traditional
 
C h a p t e r :
S p e c i a l H o u s i n g
hospital beds could also be considered 
If hospital beds are used, the
size of the doors should accommodate
the bed for emergency evacuation of
nonambulatory inmates 
 Inmates should be able to communicate
directly with staffThis capability
should, perhaps, include a nurse call
button or panic alarm that allows the
inmate to easily alert staff of a need 
 The needs of inmates with hearing or
vision impairments must be accommodated
in the cells 
 A detention-quality, Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA)-compliant, toilet
and sink should be provided; separate
fixtures are recommended 
 A small, fixed-in-place, detentionquality
desk and chair or stool should
be provided 
 A mirror and shelves with collapsible
security hooks should be provided 
 Cell doors should have a lockable food
passthrough 
 Lights should be controllable by staff,
but an option for some inmate control
might be desirable 
 Natural light should be provided to
the area through a secure means 
 Access to power, although not necessarily
inside the cell, must be considered,
as it may become necessary to
house inmates with conditions requiring
medical equipment powered by
electricity 
 Medical isolation cells should be designed
for negative pressure, where
the air from the cell is circulated out
of the building and not through any
other areas of the facility 
 A floor drain should be provided
either in the cell or just outside it 
Location
Issue: The location of medical cells should facilitate
both delivery of medical services by health
care staff and surveillance by security staff 
Response: The examination rooms, medication
storage area, and offices for medical
staff constitute the health care component
of the facility and should be located conveniently
in relation to medical cells, although
adjacency is not required if surveillance
needs are better served by some separation 
Regarding surveillance, the design should, if possible,
allow for observation or surveillance from
a constantly staffed post such as master control
and/or an officer’s or nurse’s desk, if a nurse’s
position is part of the facility programMedical
isolation cells should also be located so that
other staff can easily provide additional periodic
observation but without overexposing cells to visibility
to other inmates in nearby housing units 
Providing for this easy periodic observation is a
must if cells are not located in direct line of sight
of a constantly staffed post 
In considering these security-related spatial affiliations,
it should be remembered that inmate
patients can present the same potential security
risks as any other inmate, especially if they are
fully ambulatory (exhibit ) 
Security
Issue: Medical isolation inmates may represent
a danger to themselves or others 
Response: The design of medical isolation
cells and the selection of furnishings should
take into consideration the potential for

suicide or assaultive behavior and eliminate
visual blind spots and bars, hooks, and
other protrusions from which inmates could
hang themselves or areas that could provide
hiding placesFurther, the design should
minimize joints, pockets, and other places
that could be used to hide contraband and
weapons 
Occupants of medical isolation cells may have
poor coordination due to illness or injuryConsequently,
the design, furniture, and fixtures should
not contribute to accidental injuryFixtures
should have rounded or beveled edges, there
should be ample room to move around, and protrusions
at eye/head height should be minimized 
Disciplinary Detention/Administrative
Segregation
Issue: The design of housing areas used to
house inmates who are on disciplinary detention
or who pose a serious threat to other inmates
and staff (administrative segregation) should
accommodate the security risks posed by the inmate
and be responsive to the punitive aspects
of placing an inmate in that housing area 
Response: An inmate is placed in disciplinary
detention because of a serious violation
of facility rulesDisciplinary detention is
meant not only to separate the offending
inmate from the rest of the population, but
to discourage future bad behavior by denying
the inmate some of the privileges and
amenities available in other areasInmates
are placed in administrative segregation
because they have proven to pose a serious
threat to staff, other inmates, or the facility
by virtue of the offense(s) they are charged
with, a history of extreme violence while in
custody, or gang affiliationA more Spartan
living environment is a general objective of
disciplinary detention/administrative segregation 
However, this does not include depriving
the inmate of basic rights to
 
C h a p t e r :
S p e c i a l H o u s i n g
well-ventilated, temperature-controlled, sanitary,
well-lit, and healthful conditions 
The characteristics of a disciplinary detention or
administrative segregation area are as follows:
 It should be high security in general construction
approach, emphasizing durable, cleanable,
and vandal-resistant materials, furnishings,
equipment, and hardware 
 It is recommended that there be a small dayroom
adjacent to the disciplinary detention/
administrative segregation cellsThe dayroom
could be used for talking on the phone, watching
television (if allowed), and other passive
recreationAn outdoor or indoor/outdoor exercise
area should be provided for use by administrative
segregation inmatesSuch a space
should be sufficient to allow the inmate to obtain
required daily exerciseA dayroom shower
facility should be easily accessible from the
disciplinary cell(s) 
 No vestibule is needed because the dayroom
essentially functions as a vestibuleThis is
because the inmate is routinely locked into
the detention/administration cell for all but a
limited time for exercise and then is generally
alone 
 Natural light should be provided to cells in a
secure way 
 Cells should be larger than normal cells, given
the extensive time that inmates are required to
remain in the cell 
 Inmates should be able to communicate directly
with staff, usually through an intercom
in the cell, but audio monitoring capabilities
should be controllable by staff 
 The cell should have a fixed bed, a detentionquality
toilet and sink fixture, a desk and chair

or stool, a security mirror, security shelves,
and collapsible hooks for clothes and towels 
 Light fixtures should be controlled by staff 
 Cell doors should have a food passthrough and
restraint port 
Security view
Issue: Constant observation of the disciplinary
detention/administrative segregation area is
essential 
Response: Observation should be provided
from a constantly staffed post for effective
control over the disciplinary detention/
administrative segregation areaIt is also
advisable that this space be in a location that
other staff can easily observe when passing by 
Regarding observation, it is not necessarily desirable
to have total visual access to the cell by
fully glazing or opening the cell front (door and
front wall), especially if this exposes the inmate
to other inmates in the facility and vice versaA
more limited door window and sidelight sized
and shaped in deference to available view angles
from nearby staff posts, and that are adequate to
allow observation of key parts of the cell, would
be sufficient in most casesIn general, a partial
view of the bunk and open cell area, and a view
above the toilet fixtures provide sufficient remote
observation 
Separation
Issue: Disciplinary detention/administrative
segregation cells should be separated from the
other housing areas 
Response: The disciplinary detention/
administrative segregation area might be
observed from a staff control post that also
provides observation of other housing areas 
If so, the design of the area should provide
for physical, sound, and sight separation
from the other housing units to the greatest
degree possible 
Flexibility
Issue: The disciplinary detention/administrative
segregation area may serve other special housing
needs 
Response: The high-security construction
of the area, the presence of a dayroom and
shower, and the visibility of the area from
a staff post provide conditions under which
the area could conceivably be used to house
other classifications of inmates under certain
circumstancesFor example, if the
facility were to become overcrowded and
no one was being held in disciplinary
detention/administrative segregation, it
might be appropriate to use the housing
unit, on a short-term basis, to help relieve
the crowdingIn that circumstance, the
fundamentally hard and Spartan character
of the disciplinary detention/administrative
segregation housing area should be offset by
providing amenitiesIt would be desirable,
therefore, to consider installing outlets for
television, jacks for telephones, and other
amenities in the dayroomA small table and
seating in the dayroom would also add flexibility
to use of the area 
Mental Illness/Suicide Threat/Intoxication
Inmates who appear to have significant mental
illness, pose serious suicide threats, or are intoxicated
by drugs or alcohol require spaces that
have special characteristics that are similar to
those of disciplinary detention/administrative
segregation inmatesIn smaller jails, the infrequency
of housing some of these classifications
creates the possibility of a shared-use area 
Because suicidal, mentally ill, or intoxicated
inmates require special care and close observation,
jurisdictions are advised to seek alternatives
 
C h a p t e r :
S p e c i a l H o u s i n g
to jail for these inmates, unless the facility is
designed to accommodate these inmatesMany
jails have no choice but to accommodate such
inmates, if only until other arrangements can be
madeFor example, the mentally ill must sometimes
be kept for extended periods until a court
order can be obtained to permit transfer to an
appropriate mental health facilityIntoxicated
inmates charged with a serious crime may also
have to be held in special quarters while they
recover, if outside detoxification facilities are not
available 
The functional-architectural issues regarding
these spaces assume only the briefest of stays for
these inmatesHowever, especially in the case of
mental illness or suicidal ideation, stays may be
much longer if appropriate mental health facilities
are not available, and the jail design should
provide for this circumstance 
Because of the unique characteristics of these
spaces, it is assumed that they typically will not
be able to accommodate other classifications of
inmates 
Characteristics
Issue: The special housing needs of suicidal,
mentally ill, and intoxicated inmates must be
accommodated 
Response: Some recommended characteristics
of the spaces used for these special
groups are as follows:
 The area should be of high-security
construction that is durable, easily
maintainable, and uses vandalresistant
equipment, hardware,
and materials 
 A dayroom or small corridor area
should be adjacent to the cells, if possible 
This space provides an alternative
to confinement in the cells and a
useful sound containment barrierIf a
dayroom cannot be provided, consider
placing the cells in an area that provides
some sound isolation from the
other housing areas and the program
areas 
A shower should be easily accessible
from, but not within, the cells 
No vestibule is required for this area,
but a sound containment vestibule
might be useful 
Natural light should be provided if
possible, but not if it precludes a good
observable location for the cells 
The cells should be provided with
a detention-quality toilet and sink
fixtureThe water supply should be
restricted to cold and warm water to
preclude scalding possibilitiesFixtures
should be easily accessible but
out of the way to preclude injuries
caused by stumbling 
On occasion, especially in detoxification
cells, a raised slab approximately
inches above the floor should be
provided for sitting or sleepingHowever,
it is important to follow state
guidelines, some of which prohibit the
use of raised slabs in detoxification
cells 
Cells should be large enough to allow
easy movement by officers who may
have to struggle with, or restrain, inmates;
fixtures and slabs should not
be too difficult to negotiate 
No hardware or furniture should be
in the cells (e g , desk, stool, shelves,
hooks, or mirror)There should, however,
be sufficient room to accommodate
mobile restraint chairs, if used 







 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Ceiling height should be at least feet
so that light fixtures, sprinkler heads,
and so forth are generally inaccessible
to the inmate 
 Lights should be controlled by staff 
There should be a nightlight feature
in the cell, and the light level should
be adjustable to accommodate the
comfort of the inmate and the varying
observation needs of staff 
 The air from the space should not be
recirculated 
 Openings in grills covering supply and
return air ducts should be small, so as
to preclude suicide attempts 
 All edges should be rounded or beveled 
Padded surfaces are desirable for
suicidal inmates, if the padding provides
adequate fire protection, satisfies
local codes, and is functional and
durable 
 Doors should be heavy-gauge security
quality with a food passthrough 
An acute medical unit with mental health cellsNote the security doors and
large windows into the individual cells 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )
 A floor drain should be either in the
space or just outside itA remotely
flushed drain could be beneficial 
 A shutoff valve for cell plumbing fixtures
should be readily accessible to
staff 
Observation
Issue: Constant observation of suicidal, mentally
ill, or intoxicated inmates is critical 
Response: Constant observation of these
cells requires an effective direct view of the
space from a constantly staffed post rather
than through electronic meansElectronic
surveillance might provide a useful supplement
to staff observation 
In designing the cells for good view, the degree to
which their face is opened up with windows depends
on the location of the cells in relation to a
staff postIf the cells are located directly adjacent
to a staff post with no dayroom or other space
separating them, a smaller window is acceptable
because the staff can easily go to the window
and obtain a full view of the cell interior 
If cells are at some distance from a staff post or
at a point remote from where passing staff will
look in, it is critical to provide enough glazing
in the doors and the fronts of the cells to make
them sufficiently visibleSufficient view would
include the ability to see the inmate when lying
on the bed or using the toilet (while providing
basic privacy), and to see any spaces in which
the inmate might attempt to hide 
Location
Issue: Cells for suicidal, mentally ill, or intoxicated
inmates might best be located near or in
the receiving part of the intake-release area 
Response: Suicidal, mentally ill, or intoxicated
individuals can be quite difficult to
 
C h a p t e r :
S p e c i a l H o u s i n g
manageConsequently, it is desirable to
minimize the amount of movement involved
in bringing them into the facility and reaching
the proper housing areaPlacement of
these cells in or very near the intake-release
area is very desirableThe key to location,
however, is the ability to monitor the inmate
constantlyPeriodic observation, such as
that provided by roving staff, is helpful as a
supplement but is not recommended as the
sole source of staff surveillance

Health Care
Adequate health-care services are essential
to the well-being of arrestees and inmates
and should be viewed as a basic human
right and a basic responsibility of the jailThe
purpose is not only to serve the individual’s
needs, but also to prevent the spread of disease
within the facilityThe activities necessary to
carry out a complete, yet basic, health-care
program typically include:
 Medical screening at intake to identify
illnesses or injuries prior to admission 
 Verification of medications 
 Suicide screening at intake to identify
suicide risk 
 Solicitation of inmate health complaints
(sick call) 
 Alcohol or drug detoxification 
 Temporary care of individuals with mental
illness 
 Testing for infectious diseases (tuberculosis
is the most common) 
 Isolation of those with infectious diseases 
 Routine health appraisal 
 Emergency and first aid treatment 
 Administration of medicines 
 Infirmary care 
 Emergency dental care 
 Special medical diets 
 Health education 
 Mental health counseling 
 Cleaning and disinfecting of medical space 
There is considerable variety in how health care
is provided in jails; that is, some jails provide
health care at the facility while others take the
inmate to a clinic or emergency roomRegardless
of the arrangement for health care, some activities
must take place at the facility and require
appropriate space 
Overall, space allocations for health care in the
jail need not be extravagantIf local resources
are used for more costly and extensive services,
space for health care might range from one area
for basic examinations, first aid, medications,
records, and emergency equipment to a separate
space for each of those basic functions, in addition
to any special housing providedMany larger
facilities provide for medical examination rooms
in each housing area in an effort to reduce the
movement of inmates to and from a centralized
medical area 
State standards should be reviewed carefully;
many of them require space for health-care services
in jailsThese should be checked closely 
American Correctional Association standards
(www aca org/standards/) contain an extensive
list of operational and physical plant standards
regarding the delivery of health-care services in
local jailsThe National Commission on Correctional
Health Care (www ncchc org/) has also
published standards for health care in jails and
guidelines for health-care space and basic equipment 
These sources provide valuable information
for planning discussions 
Historically, smaller jails have suffered
from an absence of proper examination
or treatment space and an
absence of special cells in which to
house persons who have infectious
diseases, are intoxicated, or may have mental
health problemsFor some new facilities, the
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
space and equipment provided for examinations
have remained relatively idle because jail budgets
are insufficient to pay for full-time, in-house
health-care staff or because service providers in
the community will not come to the jailMany
health-care practitioners insist that inmates be
brought to their offices or to local health-care
facilitiesThis practice poses both security and
manpower problems for jail staffJoint planning
with local service providers is essential to be able
to determine appropriate space and equipment
allocations between the jail and the community
and to solicit proper involvement at the jail 
Key Decisions
As the role of the health-care component is evaluated,
the following decisions should be made
because they have a fundamental impact on design
requirements:
 To what extent and how frequently will the
required health-care services actually be
provided?
 How many inmates will receive these services?
 Which of the required health-care services can
be provided by properly trained jail employees
(e g , first aid, initial intake screening, cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR))?
 Which of the required services can and/or
should be provided at the jail by health-care
professionals (e g , routine examinations, tests,
dental care, sick call)?
 Are doctors, nurses, and dentists available to
come to the jail as contract service providers,
or will the jail hire in-house medical staff
or contract with a medical service company
specializing in providing services to detention
facilities?
 What services and facilities are available and
accessible in the community that do not need
to be duplicated at the jail, and what are the
economic and security ramifications of using
them (e g , transportation, jail officer escorts,
providing security at the community facility)?
 What level of special housing will be provided
at the jail for detoxification, medical isolation,
minor illnesses, or convalescence? How will
these areas be supervised and how will proper
medical care be provided (staff nurse, emergency
medical technician)?
 How will future growth in the jail population
or future changes in the makeup of the population
affect the methods of delivering the various
types of medical services? How will space
and equipment needs be met in the future?
Detail Issues
The following discussion about detailed
functional-architectural issues is limited to the
typical health-care functions or spaces common
to jails; a review of every issue related to health
care, such as surgery, is not necessary because
such services are rarely, if ever, provided in a local
detention facilityIssues dealing with special
housing for inmates with infectious diseases or
mental health problems are addressed in 
, “Special Housing ”
Examination Area
The following information applies to examination
areas: activities, number of rooms, room
size, work surface and access, and dental
examination 
Activities
Issue: Identify all of the activities that will occur
in the medical area 
Response: Typical activities might include
the following, depending on agency desires
and the availability of community resources:
 
C h a p t e r :
H e a l t h C a r e
 Initial screening to identify medical/
mental problems and suicide riskIf
this task is done by medical staff, it is
often done in an examination room in
the intake area 
 Response to inmate health complaints 
 Routine health assessments 
 First aid 
 Testing for infectious diseases 
 Mental health screening 
 Consultations/medical counseling 
 Emergency equipment storage 
 Minor treatment procedures (e g ,
injections, topical applications,
bandaging) 
Medical screening station in the intake area of a large jail 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )
Other possible activities include:
 Records storage 
 Records preparation and review 
 Assorted doctor/nurse office functions 
 Storage of medications 
 Minor laboratory work 
 Routine dental work (examinations, fillings,
extractions) 
 Minor x-ray work 
 Drug testing (e g , taking urine specimens) 
It is inappropriate to merge office and recordkeeping
functions with examination functions if
it means that the privacy of examinations would
be violatedFor example, it would be inappropriate
for a doctor to examine or consult with a patient
while a records clerk was nearby managing
medical files or talking on the telephone 
Number of examination rooms
Issue: The types of examination activities and
the projected workload must be identified to
determine the number of examination rooms
needed 
Response: Many smaller jails find one examination
room to be sufficientHowever,
in larger jails a variety of factors dictates the
actual number of spaces needed:
 Significant differences in functions
and equipment needs (e g , dental
versus medical examinations) 
 The variety of tasks to be performed
in the space, which dictates levels of
use 
 The projected number of inmates who
will use the space 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 The actual number of hours of operation
per day or week as they relate
to the availability of health-care
professionals 
If more than one examination room is needed,
preferably the rooms should connect or at least
be adjacent to each other in a designated medical
area in the facility 
Typical examination space and equipment 
(Photograph courtesy of Kimme & Associates )
Room size
Issue: The size of examination rooms will vary
with the level of care provided 
Response: A basic examination room might
be defined as a space whose size is determined
by the needs of basic first aid and
basic physical examinationsSuch a space
would probably have the following equipment
at a minimum:
 Examination table (with stirrups) 
 Examination stool or chair, plus a
chair for the inmate’s use 
 Examination light 
 Countertop with sink and gooseneck
faucet (foot controls for the sink are
highly recommended) 
 A small writing surface for the doctor
or nurse 
 Computer workstation for entering
medical information 
 Lockable storage cabinets and
drawers 
 Scale with measuring rod and support
pillar 
 Footstool 
 Trash and waste cans 
 Secure containers for biohazards and
sharps 
 Eye chart 
 Refrigerator to store specimens 
Other basic medical equipment, such as blood
pressure cuffs, may or may not be mounted
unitsIt is important to work with health-care
providers to determine their functional and
equipment needs 
A space as small asnet square feet could be
adequate to meet minimum functions and equipment
requirementsA space of net square
feet would be more comfortable and more typical
of standard expectations in the fieldA space of
net square feet or more might be required if
minor emergency care and additional treatment
procedures are performed (such as changing
dressings or eye or ear irrigations) 
Work surface and accessTwo of the key variables
used to determine the minimum space required
for medical examinations are the need for work
 
C h a p t e r :
H e a l t h C a r e
surfaces and for access around the examination
tableA work surface or desk is needed to allow
the doctor or nurse to write a report, to hold a
computer if inmates’ files are computerized,
and to accommodate a sink and the temporary
placement of equipment and supplies that are
used during the examination 
Access around the examination table can be
from one side to four sidesAccess on two
sides is the minimum acceptable for routine
examinations and first aid; access on four sides
is preferred because it allows for a full range of
services, including emergency medical treatment
(exhibit – ) 
E x h i b i t Access Around Examination Table
Exam Exam
Dental examinationsMany jails provide space for
dental examinations and routine dental care in
the facilityDental exam spaces can range from
 to net square feet for a single examination
unitThe extent of services to be provided determines
the size of the space (i e , visual examinations
only, or also x-rays and dental procedures
such as extracting or filling teeth)? Sample equipment
includes:
 Dental chair (approximatelyinches wide
×inches long reclined) 
 Dental unit (drills, lights, air line, water lines,
tray) 
 Area for an air compressor to power the dental
unit, which is outside of the examination
room 
 Evacuating system 
 Lockable storage cabinets and drawers 
 Countertop and sink 
 Sterilizer 
 Waste and trash cans 
 Secure containers for biohazards and sharps 
 Stools for the dentist and assistant 
 X-ray viewer 
 X-ray machine, which also requires a protected
area and lead-lined aprons 
Dental examination room in jail health-care area 
(Photograph courtesy of Kimme & Associates )
The need for examination space will increase if
both medical and dental examinations will be
performed in one areaAll examination rooms
should be sized to allow for the greatest access
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
and use and should be able to accommodate a
stretcher 
Location/security
Issue: Examination rooms should be located at
an area in the jail that accommodates safety,
security, and service delivery needs 
Response: Examination rooms should be
located on or near a main circulation corridor
to facilitate quick, easy access by inmate
patients and staff, especially from the
intake-release area if examination space is
not available in the intake areaNormally,
security staff should not have a direct view
into the examination rooms for privacy reasons,
but it is important for them to monitor
the flow of traffic in and out of the medical
areaA window that can be screened or
shuttered would be appropriate to provide
selective observationIn many cases, an officer
will be assigned to monitor the medical
area when it is in useOften that officer will
also escort the inmates to and from the area
as part of his/her duties 
When direct observation of the medical area is
not possible, it might be useful to equip the doors
with a status indicator light that signals whether
the doors are open or closedThis alerts staff to
tampering, particularly at times when the area
is not in useClosed-circuit television is also a
useful monitoring tool, as is an intercom system
between the area and the post responsible for
monitoring the areaMaster control is the constantly
staffed post that most likely should monitor
the examination area, if electronic systems are
used to monitor the area 
Security
Issue: The security of medical personnel in examination
areas should be ensured 
Response: Health-care personnel will often
be alone with inmate patients, creating
the potential for exposure to violent or aggressive
behaviorAlthough master control
might monitor the door to the examination
area or cameras in the medical waiting area
and roving security staff may be posted
outside the area, an alarm system might
be necessaryThe alarm system might consist
of a body alarm, a panic button, or a
voice-activated intercom set at decibel levels
above normal conversation (so that private
conversations cannot be routinely monitored) 
Whatever system is chosen, it is important
to preserve privacy and to be able to
prove that privacy was preserved 
Issue: Equipment and supplies in the examination
area must be secured 
Response: There must be a way to securely
store in lockable drawers or cabinets all of
the small, detached equipment items (e g ,
scissors, percussion hammers, syringes
and needles) and supplies (e g , bandages,
tongue depressors) found in an examination
area 
Communication
Issue: Two-way communications between the
examination area and a constantly staffed post
and to parties outside of the facility should be
provided 
Response: A telephone or intercom allows
the health-care provider to notify staff about
the completion of examinations, request the
next patient, obtain information, be alerted
to an emergency, and relay any other necessary
informationTelephone access to
the outside allows the health-care provider
to order medications and make referrals 
Medical staff are often assigned a radio to
 
C h a p t e r :
H e a l t h C a r e
communicate with facility staff and monitor
calls for medical assistance 
Environmental issues
Issue: The basic environmental needs of examination
areas should be accommodated 
Response: Various significant environmental
concerns should be accommodated in an
examination area:
 Lighting should be sufficient to conduct
required examinations, maintain
records, and so forthSpecial examination
lights may not be required,
depending on the nature of the examinations
and the equipment requested
by the health-care provider 
 Natural light is a pleasing feature in
an examination room, especially if
medical staff will also use this space
as an office (exhibit )If natural
light is provided, care must be taken
to provide security as well as visual
privacy 
E x h i b i t Examination Room Designed for
Natural Light

 Acoustic privacy is required so that
confidential discussions about health
care remain private and a professional
atmosphere is createdInsulating walls
and ceiling plenums, using acoustically
treated hollow metal or solidcore
wood doors, prevent sound travel
through duct systems and can help in
this regard 
 Temperature levels should be comfortable
and, perhaps, controllable within
the spaceVentilation should meet all
required codes to ensure proper conditions
and prevent recirculation of contaminated
air 
 If x-rays are performed in the examination
area, even on a small scale,
proper precautions must be taken
in the design of the room to protect
health-care personnel, staff, and
inmates 
 Cleanliness of the area is essential and
can be enhanced by the proper selection
of materials and finishesA janitor’s
closet should be easily accessible
for routine cleaning and occasional
spills 
Medication Storage
The following functional design issues apply
to the storage and distribution of medication:
activities, size, location, security, and special
characteristics 
Activities
Issue: Medication storage and distribution
needs should be determined 
Response: Some of the typical activities
found at jails include:
 Securely storing each inmate’s
prescription medicines 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Securely storing quantities of commonly
used medicines 
 Securely storing medicines that need
refrigeration 
 Preparing medicines for distribution 
 Distributing medicines and storing
trays or carts used in distribution 
 Documenting prescription needs and
distribution 
 Performing an inventory of available
supplies 
 Keeping track of distribution
schedules 
The actual preparation of prescriptions is a function
that could, but does not typically, occur at
most jails because a jail pharmacist’s salary
usually cannot be justifiedMost often a pharmacy
or hospital will fill prescriptions issued
by a physicianA licensed nurse is typically responsible
for dispensing the medications to the
inmatesIn some small facilities, the medications
are distributed to the inmates by correctional
staff; however, this practice is fraught with problems,
including proper training and compliance
with state laws 
Size
Issue: The size of the area needed for storage
and distribution of medication will depend on the
extent of the activities involved 
Response: Usually a single storage area is
sufficientThe secure area used to store
medication can be as small as a secure cabinet
in an examination room or as large as
 tonet square feet, depending on the
activities required, security and operational
policy, and the projected number of inmates
to be servedThe area’s size also depends
on whether it is part of the examination
area, which would allow necessary features
(such as sinks and work surfaces) to be
shared rather than duplicated

E x h i b i t Medication Storage Area
In general, this area should be well organized
and have sufficient space for a countertop with
a sink (exhibit )Lockable base cabinets and
wall cabinets with undercabinet lighting are useful 
A secure cabinet must be provided to store
prescription narcoticsThe medication storage
area should also include a wall-mounted tack
board for charts and schedules; a telephone or
intercom; a lockable refrigerator for medicine,
urine, and blood specimens; and a surface for
report writing or documentation that may also
accommodate a computer terminal 
In large jail systems, it is becoming more common
to use medication dispensing machines like
those used in hospitalsWhen medications are
stored in cabinets, it may be easy to select the
wrong medication or doseStaff members may
also forget to record what they select or administer 
Dispensing machines often have mechanisms
to help prevent these errors; for example, the
machine can require that a patient identification
number be entered before a medication will be
dispensedMany dispensing machines can also
interface with medical computer systems to integrate
their data with information from order
entry systems and medication administration records 
Dispensing machines can also issue alerts
 
C h a p t e r :
H e a l t h C a r e
and ask whether an adverse drug event has occurred
whenever the machine dispenses a common
reversal agent or antidote 
Location
Issue: The location of the medication storage
area should accommodate frequent use and
convenient access by authorized staff 
Response: It is important to monitor the area
in which medication is stored, preferably
by a direct line of sight from a constantly
staffed postThis is especially important if
inmates are brought to the area to receive
their medications 
The relationship of the medications storage area
to the inmate housing areas is important regardless
of whether staff bring medications to the
inmates or the inmates go to the medical area to
receive their medications 
Medication storage and distribution areas generally
consist of one of the following:
 A secure cabinet within the examination room 
 An enclosed medical storage and distribution
space opening off the examination room 
 An enclosed medical storage and distribution
space adjacent to but independent of the examination
room 
This decision is based in part on a potential conflict
that could occur if the examination room
is being used when access to medications is required
(exhibit )

In cases where daily dosages are prepared in
advance during a nurse or doctor visit, a second
medication storage cabinet might be provided in
a secure staff post such as master controlThis
facilitates staff distribution of medicines while
preserving the security of the main medication
storage area 
In medium and large facilities, more significant
space is usually provided to facilitate medication
storage and distribution and cart preparation 
Security
Issue: The medications storage area is available
to medical or security personnel only and it must
be secure from break-in 
Response: This area should have highly
controlled access and be separate from
other storage areas in the jailIf possible,
only health-care staff, or a limited number
of health-trained security staff who are expressly
authorized to distribute medications
when health-care personnel are absent from
the facility, should have access to this area 
Some additional considerations include:
 Ensure security not only through locks and
monitored security doors accessing the medications
storage area, but also through the
construction of fully secure walls, floors, and/
or ceilings if secure walls do not extend to the
roof or floor construction above 
 Secure the ductwork and any other penetrations
in the area through which inmates might
gain access 
 Create at least two locked barriers between the
area where medications are stored and areas
where inmates are frequently present 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Special characteristics
Issue: The contents of the medications storage
area are subject to frequent inventory 
Response: Shelf design enhances the inventory
processUndercabinet and shelf lighting
along with moveable (rather than rigid)
shelving facilitates the organization and
inventory process 
Miscellaneous Issues
The following functional-architectural issues address
other elements that might be part of an
examination area configuration or that might
be separate health-care spaces: record storage,
staff work area/offices, first aid kits, emergency
equipment, toilet facilities, inmate waiting, and
personal protective equipment kitsAll of these
elements are appropriate and are fairly common
in jails 
Record storage
Issue: Secure medical record storage should be
provided 
Response: The following considerations
should guide the development of storage
areas for medical records 
 Health records are confidential and
should be kept secure and separate
from other inmate records and under
the custody of medical personnel only 
 The key to proper location of health
records is that they must be accessible
to health-care staff work areas and
highly secured from casual access by
unauthorized staff or inmates 
 Computerized medical records should
be stored on a secure server in either a
secured computer equipment room or
off site 
Staff work area
Issue: A work area for health-care personnel
should be provided 
Response: An area should be provided to
write reports and prescriptions, complete
forms, and store forms and suppliesIn
smaller jails where health-care personnel
visit only periodically (once or twice
a week), a small work area with lockable
storage files is satisfactoryLockable storage
for equipment owned by health-care
staff should also be accommodatedOffice
space separate from the examination area is
desirable for full-time medical personnel in
the jail or for community medical personnel
who spend substantial amounts of nonexamination
time at the jailAdditional considerations
include:
 Separate office space should be adjacent
to, but not accessible solely
through, the examination space 
 If health-care personnel are available
 hours a day and medical isolation
cells are also provided, consider creating
a direct-view link between the two
areas 
 Work areas should have telephones
with outside lines and should have an
alarm system (e g , a voice-activated
intercom or panic button) if inmates
are ever in the space alone with staff 
Space should be provided for a computer
terminal and printer to facilitate
recordkeeping 
 Office space should be large enough
to accommodate private consultations
and record storage as well as staff
needs for work surfaces and personal
storageInformation about private
medical or mental health counseling

“Programs and Services ”
 Work areas should have visual and
acoustic privacyHowever, if a partial
view is desired at certain times, consider
the placement of a side light in
the wall of the area that can be covered
by curtains or blinds when privacy
is desired 
First aid kits
Issue: First aid kits should be available in all
housing areas and control rooms 
Response: First aid kits should be standard
equipment in all jailsThey should be readily
accessible to staff but secured from inmate
access and tampering 
Medical emergency equipment
Issue: Storage needs for medical emergency
equipment should be accommodated 
Response: In addition to first aid kits, the
following medical emergency equipment is
necessary for proper emergency response, in
even the smallest jail:
 Wheelchair 
 Nebulizer 
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation masks 
 Stretcher 
 Crutches and/or walkers 
 Defibrillator 
 Oxygen 
 Splints 
These items should be stored in a secure and
controlled spaceHowever, unlike areas used to
store medications and medical records, the space
for emergency equipment must be easily accessible
to staff on all shifts as well as to health-care
personnel 
Toilet facilities
Issue: Toilet facilities should be available in the
health-care area 
Response: Health-care staff should have access
to an accessible staff toilet that is close
to, but not necessarily in, the health-care
areaA private, accessible inmate toilet
should be located close to or in the healthcare
component for obtaining samples as
well as for general use by inmatesIn addition
to separate detention-quality toilets and
sink fixtures, the area should have a tamperproof
mirror, soap dispenser, towel dispenser,
and waste receptacleA small shelf
for samples should also be provided unless
there is sufficient surface area on the sink 
Inmate waiting
Issue: The need for inmate waiting areas should
be identified 
Response: A separate, secure inmate waiting
area would be needed when groups
of two or more inmates are brought to the
health-care area at the same timeWaiting
in groups by standing or sitting in adjacent
corridors is discouraged, especially if it occurs
in a high-traffic corridor or a corridor
that serves as a primary means of egress 
Some considerations include:
 Appropriate seating should be provided
for the inmate waiting areaThis
area should be adjacent to the examination
area and, preferably, should be
visible from a constantly staffed post 
 Space for the inmate waiting area
should be abouttonet square
feet per person, which is adequate
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
for both seating and for movement
around the seating area 
Personal protective equipment kits
Issue: Personal protective equipment kits should
be available 
Response: Personal protective equipment
kits to protect staff from inmate body fluids
should be standard equipmentThese kits
commonly contain plastic bags for waste
that is contaminated by body fluids, disposable
gloves, germicide hand cleaner, a CPR
barrier, a gown, a surgical mask, and goggles 
Equipment for the disposal of sharps
(e g , needles) should also be available 
Personal protective equipment kits should be
located where they are readily accessible to staff
but secured from inmate tamperingLockable
wall-mounted kits near intake-release and inmate
housing are preferable

Visiting Areas
Visiting is one of the crucial links between
inmates and the communityIt provides
a way for inmates to communicate (other
than by telephone or mail) with family, friends,
and other community members, such as attorneys
and clergy members from outside the
jailVisiting is extremely important to inmates
because it enables them to keep in touch with
family members, friends, business associates,
ministers, and attorneysBecause visiting is so
important to inmates, it is one of the jail’s most
effective tools in managing their behavior 
In older jails, visiting commonly occurred in the
cellblocks rather than in areas set aside specifically
for visitingThese cellblock areas were
characterized by a complete lack of privacy;
physical conditions dangerous for staff, visitors,
and inmates; and poor security featuresVisitors
and inmates had to stand, view each other
through tiny vision ports, and strain to speak and
be heard through heavily meshed “voice boxes”
in spaces with very poor acoustic qualitiesThe
introduction of contraband was a significant
problem given the visiting area’s location within
the security envelope 
In modern jails, visits with friends and family
usually occur in private, noncontact spaces
where physical comfort and limited privacy are
better affordedThese design improvements reflect
case law that has condemned the lack of
quality visiting space and conditions 
Recently, the use of “video” visitation has become
more common—the visitor communicates
with the inmate via a video monitor located either
in the jail lobby or at another locationThe
inmate has access to visitors using a booth located
most often in the housing area or at another
location within the secure perimeterThe advantage
to video visitation is that it eliminates any
possibility of passing contraband and reduces the
security required for inmate visitationThe cost
of installing a video visitation system is often offset
by the decrease in staff costs associated with
visiting (i e , screening visitors, moving inmates
to a centrally located visiting area, supervising
visits) 
Contact visiting tends to be limited to attorneys,
counselors, and other “professional” visitors; contact
visits with family, when permitted, are usually
limited to low-security inmates such as inmate
workers or others during special occasions at the
discretion of jail officialsIn some jurisdictions,
contact visiting is accommodated in multipurpose
rooms and outdoor recreation yards 
A variety of spaces are needed for visiting,
including:
 Space for both noncontact and contact visiting
for both personal and professional visitors

 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Visiting facilities that accommodate inmates
and visitors who have disabilities 
 A visitor reception desk or area in or adjacent
to the public lobby 
 A visitor waiting area that has public restrooms,
a telephone, and a drinking fountain 
 A storage area for visitors’ personal property
that is prohibited from visiting areas (essential
for contact visiting) 
 An area in which to search inmates in privacy
following their visit (essential for contact
visiting) 
 An area for occasional searches of visitors suspected
of carrying contraband 
Courts have generally held that inmates should
be allowed to visit with family, friends, religious
advisers, prospective employers, and the news
media within a reasonable jail scheduleVirtually
all states and national agencies with jail standards
require and address the provision of visiting
opportunities and facilitiesPlanners should
check applicable state standards for mandatory
requirements

Key Decisions
As the role of the visiting component is evaluated,
the following decisions will have a fundamental
effect on design requirements:
 How much space should be provided for visiting?
How many inmates will be able to visit at
the same time and how many visitors will be
allowed to visit with each inmate? How long
will visits last? How much access to visiting is
required by standards?
 Will visitors move to a visiting area located
next to inmate living areas or will inmates
move to a central visiting area located near
the public entry?
 Will inmates be allowed to have contact visits
with family or lawyers and, if so, which classifications
of inmates will be allowed to do so?
How will staff be made available for intensive
screening of visitors and searches of inmates?
Will space be dedicated for contact visiting or
will some other space (such as a multipurpose
room) be used?
 Will inmates and visitors communicate over
a telephone or more directly (e g , via a sound
port)?
 Will video visiting technologies be used to
either replace or supplement certain forms of
visiting? If so, how will it work and where will
it be done?
 Which staff post will supervise the visiting
area? How will inmate movement to visiting
areas be monitored?
 Where will visitors be received? Who will receive
them? How will packages, money, and
other items that visitors bring to inmates be
processed?
 
C h a p t e r :
V i s i t i n g A r e a s
Detail Issues
The following detailed functional-architectural
issues should be considered in the development
of the visiting component: activities, the size of
spaces, the number of visiting stations, location/
movement, security, and quality 
Activities
Issue: It must be determined how basic visiting
activities will be accommodated, which staff
member will conduct or supervise them, and
where they will take place 
Response: The following activities usually
pertain to visiting:
 The visitor arrives and is registered
and screened for security (person and
materials) by staffIt is common to
prohibit visitors from bringing items
(e g , purses, diaper bags, heavy
coats) into visitingAttorneys are
often allowed to bring in legal paperwork,
which must be searchedOften,
there are limits on briefcases and the
amount of paperwork that is allowed 
 Staff determines which inmate the
visitor desires to see and whether the
visit will be allowed 
 The visitor is directed to the waiting
area and is informed about rules and
length of visits 
 The visitor stores personal property
(e g , coats, hats, purses) in the locker
area 
 Staff determines where the inmate is
and either communicates with other
staff, who will escort the inmate to
the visiting area, or escorts the inmate
personally (assuming visiting is
centralized) 
 The inmate and visitor are escorted
to the visiting booth or room after the
visitor is scanned by a metal detector
and perhaps pat searched if it is a contact
visit 
 Staff supervises the visit, ensuring
that behavior is acceptable and within
rules (especially important with contact
visiting and official interviews) 
 Staff informs parties that the visit is
over or responds to their request to
end the visit 
 Staff observes the inmate’s return to
the housing area (he or she may be
subject to some form of search) and
the visitor returns to the waiting area 
 The visitor is checked out and any
stored property is returned 
Size of Spaces
Issue: The size of visiting spaces is determined
by the number of users and by comfort and security
considerations 
Response: The size of noncontact visiting
spaces is determined by the following
considerations:
 Spaces should be wide enough to comfortably
accommodate more than one visitor and one
inmate at the same timeIf no information is
available to determine a proportion, design at
least half of the noncontact spaces as double
stations to accommodate two visitors (exhibit
) 
 Spaces should be deep enough to allow
visitors to:
Sit rather than stand (chairs should be
provided) 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Have adequate privacy screening on either
side of the space (without screening staff’s
view) 
Move comfortably around and behind the
space (especially if moveable chairs are
used) 
It is recommended that the depth of the visiting
area be sufficient to accommodate a small
counter surface for leaning or writing 
 Determine whether each individual visiting
station is a fully enclosed space or if it shares
space with a series of other visiting stationsIf
an enclosed space is chosen for greater privacy
and control, allow extra space because these
enclosures can feel quite confiningAllow for
movement into and out of chairs and for door
swings (the inmate side should swing out, if
possible) 
 The dimensions should be sufficient to allow
access by inmates or visitors with disabilities,
particularly those in wheelchairsFlexibility
in seating is important to consider as wellIf
security seating is generally preferred, consider
detention-quality swing-out seating to allow
wheelchair access 
E x h i b i t Single and Double Visiting Stations
Single station
Double station
Contact visiting spaces should be sized based on
the number of users and types of activitiesFor
contact with professional visitors, spaces should
be fully enclosed and private, if possibleIn most
cases, two users are involved: the inmate and the
visitor (lawyer, bondsperson, counselor)A desk
surface and chairs are also required 
Occasionally more than one visitor may be involved
in a contact visit with an inmateIf this
possibility exists, at least one area of sufficient
size should be available to accommodate this
circumstance 
The jail administration may want to consider allowing
contact visits to occur in a multipurpose
room with different visiting groups sharing the
space at the same timeThis is more common in
minimum-security housing areasIn this case,
the space should be large enough to allow sufficient
distance between the groups to retain some
degree of privacyLarge numbers of people generate
enough sound to mask each other’s conversations
(as occurs in a restaurant) 
Open-backed visiting stations within one large enclosed visiting room, all
with good visibility and easy accessibility 
(Photograph courtesy of Liebert & Associates )
For security reasons, primarily concerning passage
of contraband, it is recommended that contact
visiting not occur in inmate program and
service areas such as a multipurpose room(See
 
C h a p t e r :
V i s i t i n g A r e a s
 , “Programs and Services,” for further
discussion on this topic )
Issue: Visitor waiting areas must be sized
appropriately 
Response: The size of the visitor waiting
areas should be determined based on the
following considerations:
 Visitors usually wait in the public lobby 
If the building serves law enforcement,
courts, and other functions,
the total lobby area should be large
enough to accommodate waiting visitors 
However, if the lobby is restricted
to jail functions or if jail visitors wait
in a space separate from the public
lobby, that space should provide at
leastsquare feet per person (preferably
 square feet to allow for adequate
circulation) 
 The number of expected visitors must
be determined, which largely depends
on how visiting is administered at the
jailIn jails that offer open visiting
(i e , unscheduled visiting that is done
on a “first come, first served” basis),
the maximum number of visitors must
be determined and the space designed
accordinglyIdeally, visiting is scheduled
so that the number of visitors
in the area at any one time can be
predicted accuratelyFor example, if
the jail can accommodatevisits at
one time, allows half-hour visits, and
provides hours of visiting time per
day, jail staff could expect to have no
more thantopeople waiting at
one time to accommodatetotal visits
in a scheduled situation (based on
or visitors per inmate visit)However,
in an unscheduled situation, it is
possible thattovisitors (or
visitors per inmate) could arrive at the
jail at the same time, thus requiring
substantially more square footage in
the lobby/waiting area 
 Waiting areas should also provide
space for visitor lockersThe amount
of space required for the lockers depends
on the number of lockers needed,
which in turn is dependent on:
The number of visitors in the facility at
any one time who need lockers 
The amount of items to be stored in the
lockers 
The size of each locker 
Lockers do not need to be in a separate space 
They can be part of the visitor waiting area or in
an alcove just off the waiting areaLocker size
depends on the items to be stored (normally
coats, hats, purses, and briefcases) and the manner
in which articles of clothing are to be stored
(folded or on hangers)Visitor lockers should
not be confused with the secure weapons storage
lockers required at all ingress points to the facility 
(More information about lockers is given later
in this ) 
The inmate waiting area is another consideration 
It may be desirable to have a waiting area for
those inmates who are ready to move into the
visiting space during the next visiting period 
This area might be a separate room or a small alcove
located near an access corridorIt should be
under direct staff surveillance or supervision because
inmates of different classifications may be
waiting at the same timeIf this occurs, it may be
prudent to provide separate or segmented waiting
areas (all observable from a single point) 
Other elements related to the public lobby (such
as toilets, telephones, and drinking fountains)
should be accessible from the waiting area/lobby,
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
as discussed in, “Administration and
Public Areas ” All elements should be accessible
to persons with disabilities 
Number of Visiting Stations
Issue: The number of separate visiting stations
needed depends on the projected number of
visitors and on how visitors will be scheduled 
Response: To determine the number of visiting
stations, the following factors must be
considered:
 How many visits each inmate will
have per week, on average 
 How long each visit will be, on average
or at minimum 
 How many hours will be set aside
per week for visiting (e g , Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, p mto
p m , and Saturday and Sunday, noon
to p m , would totalhours per
week) 
 Visitation needs when the jail population
is at a peak (occasionally beyond
design capacity) 
Following are some assumptions regarding the
factors that affect space needs for fully occupied
jailsThese factors are then applied to a sample
formula that shows how to calculate the number
of stations needed (exhibit ) 
The formula used to calculate the number of
stations is:
For the -bed jail example above, the formula
works out as:
These calculations should be done separately for
both contact and noncontact visiting 
Location/Movement
Issue: The method selected for providing inmate
and public access to visiting areas can greatly
influence facility design 
Response: In general, there are two basic arrangements
for a noncontact visit between
an inmate and a visitorEach has a major
impact on design:

 Moving the inmate to the visitor (customary) 
This usually requires significant
staff time because inmates must
be taken from their living areas to a
visiting area near the public lobby, unless
movement can be achieved without
escort by properly locating staff
posts and/or closed-circuit television
cameras (exhibit ) 
 Moving the visitor to the inmateThis
is done via a separate circulation corridor
from the public lobby to visiting
stations outside of, but adjacent to,
inmate housingInmates enter the
visiting booth directly from their dayroom
without staff escortIn favorable
circumstances, visitors can also move
unescorted through separate visitor
corridors to minimize demands on
staff 
Accommodating visitors at the housing units
presents problems because the visitor must move
deep into the facility, although outside the secure
envelop of the housing areas, to reach the housing
unitsThere are two key considerations with
this concept:
 A second, totally secure visitor corridor must
be created to ensure that the jail’s security
envelope is not violatedThis is frequently

)There are no penetrations in this corridor
that allow access to inmate areasEgress
from this corridor should be down a secure,
dedicated elevator or set of stairs or through a
secure exit that does not involve the security
envelope of the jail 
 The visiting areas at the housing unit must
provide sight and sound privacy but allow for
the officer in the housing area to supervise the
area 
For the small jail in particular, this
approach to visiting must be closely
evaluatedIt could create unnecessary
expense and complications because
moving inmates to a central visiting
area does not normally involve great distances
or many people at one timeTherefore, this idea
does not offer the time, movement, and staffsaving
elements that make the concept attractive
to medium and large jails 
Video visiting
Visiting using video equipment (cameras and
monitors) changes the discussion of location considerably 
Installation of a video visiting system
essentially allows the public visitor to stay in or
near the lobby or even at a remote location and it

allows the inmate to stay in or near the housing
unitThis method negates concerns about security
and passage of contraband that are usually
associated with visiting 
The use of video, however, does not negate the
need to create private visiting stations for the
inmate and the visitorIn addition, it creates the
need for designs that protect the equipment at
both locations while allowing for easy maintenance 
Nonetheless, staff time and effort can be
saved due to reduced inmate movement, security
searches, and staff surveillance 
In assessing the appropriateness of video visiting,
local laws and statutes must be taken into
account and fears of illegal monitoring must be
addressed, although it is often allowable to monitor
or record nonprofessional visitsThe quality
of the visit must also be evaluated in terms of
its consistency with the facility’s mission and its
effectiveness in satisfying programmatic and behavior
management goals 
Arrestee visiting
The visiting access needs of arrestees in the
intake-release area should also be consideredAn
arrestee may need to consult with family members
or a bondsperson about release arrangements 
One response might be to place a visiting
station in the intake-release areaSuch a space
should:
 Have a controllable access point for the visitor,
especially if access is directly from outside 
 Be noncontact, constructed with security partitions,
security ceilings and floors, security
glazing and framing, and a secure means of
communication 
 Be monitored by staff 
 Have a secure paper pass for obtaining signatures
on papers, if appropriate to the operational
policy

Security
Issue: Certain safeguards must be implemented
to maintain security and prevent the passage of
contraband during visitation 
Response: The following considerations help
provide adequate security for the visiting
component:
 All visitors should be required to pass
through a metal detector to screen for
weapons prior to entering the jail’s
visiting areaThis typically requires a
staff member to be posted at the point
of access to the visiting area to operate
the machine, but this position can often
double as the reception pointThis
position should be supported by direct
visual monitoring from a constantly
staffed post, such as master control 
 All nonprofessional visitors who participate
in contact or noncontact visiting
will normally be required to place
all personal belongings and outer garments
in a locked storage space in the
 
C h a p t e r :
V i s i t i n g A r e a s
public lobbyLockers might be operated
using a coin, token, or key, depending
on whether jail staff have control
over themIf staff control the use of
the lockers, planners must decide who
will issue the token or key and how
issuance and return will be accomplished 
If coins are used to access the
lockers, planners must decide if the
coin will be returned or kept to offset
the costs of maintaining the lockers 
 An area should be designated to
search inmates privately, particularly
after contact visits 
 Signs should be posted that alert visitors
to the fact that they are subject to
search if there is reasonable belief that
they threaten staff, inmate, or public
safety 
 Signs should be posted in the public
lobby to inform the public about
rules and regulations for visiting (e g ,
length of visit, acceptable behavior,
proper attire) and the sanctions for
violation of the rules 
 Access to visiting should be through a
security vestibule controlled by staff,
rather than directly from the waiting
area/lobby (exhibit ) 
 Staff should be posted so they can
visually monitor the visiting area and
the security vestibule 
 A means of communication should be
provided for staff to speak to visitors
and inmates in facility designs where
the supervising officer is posted outside
the visiting areaCommunications
are needed to correct misbehavior as
well as to announce the beginning and
end of visiting periods 
 A means of communication by which
visitors can voluntarily speak to supervising
staff should be considered 
It should be physically activated by
the visitor rather than voice activated
to avoid accusations of unauthorized
monitoring and privacy violations 
 The wall separating the visitor and
the inmate should be part of a defined
internal security zone (if not the main
security envelope) that precludes
penetrationThis includes the vision
panel, panel framing, and the communication
device used if it forms part
of the wall’s securityThe ceiling and
floor elements that help form the zone
also should be constructed securely 
Quality
Issue: The quality of the visiting area is important
in responding to the needs of both the visitor
and the inmate 
Response: There are a variety of ways in
which the integrity and quality of the visit
can be reinforced in design 
 Communication between the visitor
and the inmate in noncontact visiting
must be of good quality (sufficiently
loud and clear)The best way to

achieve good sound quality is to use
telephonesTwo telephones should
be provided on the visitor side of
two-person stationsCommunication
through the window frame (as offered
by some detention equipment
manufacturers) is also an optionPerforations
in the top of the sill of the
window frame have been used successfully
for communication purposes 
The key to this approach is to provide
enough perforations to allow satisfactory
sound transfer but to ensure that
no contraband can be passed through
them 
 Acoustic treatment of the space should
allow for sound levels that permit
privacy and conversation without raising
one’s voiceSound transfer from
neighboring visiting areas should be
minimized and, if possible, excluded
through the provision of generous
amounts of sound-absorbing material 
Acoustics within fully enclosed individual
noncontact spaces can be of
poor quality (sound reverberation) unless
sound-absorbing materials are
provided 
 Noncontact visiting booths should
provide ample space for comfort and
include a counter surface for writing
or leaning 
 In noncontact visiting stations, the inmate
and visitor should be able to see
each other comfortably by means of
a fairly large security-glazed window 
This not only enhances the view but
makes the otherwise small visiting
spaces seem largerFacilities should
determine whether visitors will be
seated, standing, or both, although it
is recommended that there be a sufficient
number of chairs available for
the maximum number of visitors, excluding
lap children 
 Natural light is beneficial to the quality
and openness of the visiting area

E x h i b i t Components of Visiting Areas

 
Exercise Areas
C h a p t e r
Active indoor and outdoor exercise outside
the housing units is important to the
physical and mental well-being of inmates
and to facility security because it provides a positive
outlet for inmate energyOutdoor exercise
is thought to be especially beneficial to both
emotional and physical well-being because of
exposure to fresh air and sunlight and because it
provides a temporary release from confinement
within the building 
The most typical kinds of active exercise found in
jails are:
 Basketball 
 Volleyball 
 Handball 
 Walking 
 Weightlifting 
 Calisthenics 
In the past, many jails did not provide both indoor
and outdoor exercise areasIn those that
provided neither, exercise was limited to individual
efforts to do calisthenics in cells or dayrooms 
In older jails where crowding has become a serious
issue, indoor recreation areas such as gymnasiums
have been converted to housing areas with
the addition of bunks, eliminating the use of the
area for exercise 
The provision of indoor and outdoor exercise
areas in new jails has generally become an expected
practiceOrganized recreational programs
that involve trained recreational staff, competition,
and training are becoming more common in
larger jails, but often cannot be accommodated in
smaller jails 
Outdoor exercise differs from indoor recreation in
that it features very physical and vigorous activities
that require special space and equipment 
Indoor recreation is addressed in,
“Programs and Services ”
Jail administrators report that the availability of
indoor and outdoor exercise areas is associated
with fewer operational problems such as inmateon-
inmate assaults, inmate assaults on staff,
damage to jail property, and lawsuitsThese benefits
are in addition to the health and psychological
benefits for inmates 
Key Decisions
The following decisions should be made when
evaluating the role of the exercise component,
as they have a fundamental effect on design
requirements:
 Will both outdoor and indoor exercise space
be provided or only one or the other? Will an
indoor/outdoor exercise area with large windows
that open for light and ventilation or a
retractable, mesh-covered roof be provided,
instead of two separate exercise areas?
 Will indoor exercise areas be provided outside
the inmate housing units, or will special exercise
areas be incorporated into the housing
units? If exercise areas are outside, will the
areas be adjacent to the housing units or
will there be one central exercise area for all
male and female inmates (general and special
housing)?
 Will groups of inmates be mixed to some degree,
or will they exercise separately according
to housing unit group? If the former, what will
be the makeup and size of each mixed exercise
group?
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Who will monitor the exercise activity and
how?
 If outdoor exercise space is provided, should it
double as emergency evacuation space?
 Should exercise areas be sufficient in size and
number to accommodate a future expanded
inmate capacity?
Detail Issues
Thisexamines the general functionalarchitectural
issues that pertain to the development
of exercise areas as well as specific issues
related to combination indoor and outdoor exercise
areas, indoor exercise areas, and outdoor
exercise areas 
General Issues
The following issues apply to both indoor and
outdoor exercise: users, size, number of areas,
support space, movement and control, and
communication 
Users
Issue: The numbers and types of people to use
exercise areas should be determined 
Response: There are two principal types of
potential users:
 Inmates 
 Law enforcement or jail officers, as
part of their fitness or community involvement
programs 
When designing centralized exercise areas it
is important to identify the number of inmate
groups that must exercise at separate times
because of classification and supervision concerns 
These groupings should respect the basic
classification/separation requirements of the
facility unless the level of staff supervision for
exercise is sufficiently high to allow some merging
of groups housed separately 
Once the number and types of groups are identified,
the maximum group size should be determined,
because that size will influence space
and equipment requirements as well as staffing
needsThe possibility for capacity expansion
should also be identified to determine whether a
larger group might someday need to be accommodated
or whether additional exercise spaces
should be planned 
Size
Issue: The size of exercise areas should be
based on activities and group sizes 
Response: Activities should be chosen on
the basis of what is most useful and productive
for the inmates and the staff alikeDifferent
activities require different amounts of
spaceFor example, a small half-court basketball
area would require, – ,net
square feet (regulation high school dimensions)
with a ceiling height of – feet,
whereas a calisthenics area might require
only about net square feet and a-foot
ceiling height for the same number of users 
Additionally, each space may have secondary areas
to accommodate other activities concurrently
(e g , weightlifting and basketball)Seating areas
may be provided for those who are resting between
activities, awaiting an opportunity to participate,
or, in the case of outdoor exercise areas,
merely enjoying the fresh air 
The number of people to use an exercise area at
any one time clearly affects space sizeTwelve
people playing two-on-games of basketball,
for instance, would require two half-court areas
at about, – ,net square feet total 
However, eight people playing one-on-game
need only about, – ,net square feet, not
 
C h a p t e r :
E x e r c i s e A r e a s
counting secondary areas for sitting, weightlifting,
or other activities (exhibit ) 
Number of areas
Issue: The number of separate exercise areas
needed depends on scheduling, staffing, and the
number of different exercise groups 
Response: While larger jails have multiple
exercise areas, smaller jails may need only
one indoor and one outdoor exercise area or
one combination areaHowever, the number
of exercise areas that will be needed
in a given facility cannot be known with
certainty until a variety of factors are considered 
Additionally, space-sharing options
with other functions cannot be ascertained
until all factors about exercise area use are
considered 
Scheduling is a major determinant regarding the
number of areas:
 Frequency: how often inmates will exercise
outside the housing area—once a week? days

often dependent on the organization’s philosophy
regarding inmate management and standards
requirements regarding exercise 
 Duration: the length of time per exercise period,
including movement time between housing
and exercise areas, if the exercise area is
not attached to the housing unit— minutes?
hour? hours?
 Hours of operation: the number of hours per
day the exercise area is available for useThis
is frequently limited by other basic activities,
such as food service and visiting, that absorb
staff and inmate time during the day 
 Weather conditions: the number of days per
year that weather would typically prohibit use
of an outdoor exercise area might influence the
size and type of space for the indoor area 
Staffing is a major consideration, particularly
when staff must be retained to supervise the exercise
activityThe need or desire to minimize
staffing can limit the hours available for exercise

F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
The number of different groups that need to exercise
is critical because both smaller and larger
jails can easily generate todifferent groups
if there is a strict adherence to housing unit
separation 
Support space
Issue: Space should be provided for staff who
supervise exercise activities 
Response: Staff can be accommodated in
several ways:
 An enclosed or open-counter control
post immediately adjacent to, but separate
from, the exercise areaThis is
common in direct supervision housing
where the exercise area is attached to
the housing area, often with windows
separating the two areas 
 An enclosed or open-counter post in
visual contact with, but separate from,
the exercise area and also monitoring
other areas such as housing 
 An open post within the exercise area
sufficient to allow staff to observe
without getting in the way of activity 
In providing staff space, it is important to give
the officer a communication link to master
control (assuming that master control does not
observe exercise)Backup monitoring by closedcircuit
television (CCTV) may be useful to ensure
the safety of the officer, especially when the officer
is within the space directly supervising the
inmates 
Issue: Equipment storage should be provided 
Response: A lockable area adjacent to the
exercise area allows for the secure storage of
exercise and maintenance equipment: basketballs,
handballs, volleyballs, volleyball
nets, weights, brooms, hoses, etcSmaller
items may be stored in cabinet space at the
control post that monitors exercise 
Issue: The design should consider basic human
needs 
Response: Depending on the duration of
each exercise period, it may be appropriate
to provide a drinking fountain and a restroom
for centralized exercise areasSuch
amenities in outdoor exercise areas must
be protected against freezing conditions in
colder locationsRestrooms should be designed
to provide privacy as well as appropriate
monitoring and control 
Shower and/or locker areas are typically not necessary
for inmates since they can use the facilities
in their housing unitIf staff are to use the
exercise area, the location of any such facilities
for them should be considered in light of access
to the exercise area 
Issue: Office space for professional exercise/
recreation staff should be considered 
Response: If the jail is large enough to support
formal exercise and recreation programs
requiring professional staff, office
space should be consideredSuch space
should be close to the exercise areas to allow
some supervision capability 
Movement and control
Classification and separation criteria should be
evaluated when developing the movement and
control scheme to prevent unwanted contact
among different inmate groups 
Issue: Determine how inmates will gain
access to exercise areas and how they will
be monitored 
 
C h a p t e r :
E x e r c i s e A r e a s
Response: Some movement and surveillance
concepts follow 
 Have one large central location to which all inmates
are moved and subsequently monitored
by staff assigned to that area (exhibit ) 
 Have inmates move to one large location monitored
by a constantly staffed post that also
monitors other areas such as housing (e g ,
master control or housing control) (exhibit
) 
 Create exercise areas immediately adjacent to
each housing unit or cluster to be monitored
by a constantly staffed post that also monitors
other areas such as housing, thus eliminating
movement of inmates through corridors to
exercise areas and maximizing use of a fixed
staff post (exhibit ) 
A benefit of placing outdoor exercise areas adjacent
to housing units is that they can securely
introduce natural light into dayrooms (and potentially
cells) and serve as directly accessible
temporary containment areas in case of an emergency 
Another benefit is increased accessibility
to the area by the inmates, thereby increasing
the number of hours each inmate is allocated for
exercise

Communication
Issue: There should be a means of communication
between staff and inmates when they are in
the exercise area 
Response: Roving security and/or control
post staff must be able to communicate with
the inmates and staff in the exercise area 
Depending on staff location and roles, the
following methods might be considered to
communicate with inmates when staff are
not present in the exercise area:
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Intercom 
 Public address speaker 
 Direct voice communication through
an opening in the exercise wall 
Issue: Minimizing opportunities for vandalism
and damage 
Response: Light fixtures, vent grills, drain
covers, and other details in both indoor and
outdoor exercise areas should be handled in
the same secure and protected manner as
they would be within housing units 
Combination Indoor and Outdoor Exercise
Issue: A single space that functions as both an
indoor and outdoor exercise area can be a prudent
choice for some jurisdictions 
Response: In some jurisdictions, it is allowable
to create a single, specially designed
space that simultaneously meets standards
for indoor and outdoor exerciseCombining
these functions can be a less costly and
more space-efficient way of providing both
capabilitiesIt may also mean a greater likelihood
that both capabilities will be made
available to inmates in smaller jails, as it is
easier to design one large space manageable
from a fixed staff post than it is to design
two such spaces 
Climate is also a motivator for the dual-use concept 
In cold northern climates, providing a large
outdoor exercise area, with expensive high walls,
costly structure and screening overhead, and
perhaps a second dedicated staff post is difficult
to justify when periods of use are limitedIn climates
with long rainy seasons, an outdoor exercise
area becomes useless for extended periods 
The primary method of creating the dual capability
exercise area is to create a large opening
in one or more walls of an indoor space and to
superimpose a moveable window or rollup shutter
over the openingWith this technique, fresh
air can be provided to inmates once the window/
shutter is opened, thus satisfying the technical
definition of “outdoor” exercise 
Other design considerations include the
following:
 The openings must be covered by a protective
screen that prevents escape and precludes contraband
passage 
 The space should be tall (– feet high) so
that openings can ( ) be large enough to allow
significant fresh air movement and ( ) have
a sill height considerably above inmate head
height so as to minimize outside view conflicts
with the public 
 The openings should be oriented to allow
the introduction of sunlight, and/or skylights
should be provided

mesh covering the open windows 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )
 
C h a p t e r :
E x e r c i s e A r e a s
 The walls of the indoor space must be developed
as though they were exterior walls, that
is, they must be impervious to rain and cold 
 The floor of the space must have drains 
 The space should be heated and cooled like
other indoor areas; however, these systems
might run independently to allow them to be
turned off when the windows are opened for
air flow 
In considering the dual-use exercise space concept,
a jurisdiction should recognize that the
chief deficiencies of this option are that exposure
to open air and sunlight is limited and that the
“outdoor” space is typically smaller than normally
providedBefore committing to the concept, a
jurisdiction should verify that the concept:
 Is consistent with the facility mission and
goals 
 Provides adequate exposure to outdoor air
and sunlight 
 Is consistent with applicable codes and jail
standards 
Indoor Exercise
The following detailed functional-architectural
issues apply to indoor exercise: multipurpose
functioning and environmental considerations 
Multipurpose functioning
Issue: If an indoor exercise area is to be used
for more than exercise functions, the functions
should be carefully selected and appropriately
accommodated through design 
Response: Jails sometimes attempt to use
the indoor exercise area for other functions
such as library, chapel, and counseling,
among othersFor such multiple users,
some special accommodations may be
neededFor example, to use an indoor exercise
area as a library, exercise must be
limited to light and restricted activities, such
as table tennis or weightlifting, and/or the
library stacks must be in shuttered cases
or in areas that can be partitioned off for
protection during vigorous activityHowever,
the characteristics of an exercise area
used for vigorous activities are generally
not compatible with those desired for other
program/service activities in terms of functions,
materials, and environmental quality 
More on the subject of multipurpose use
can be found in, “Programs and
Services ”
Contact visiting areas are generally not compatible
with exercise spaces because contraband
could be hidden during visiting hours and retrieved
later during exercise periods when thorough
body searches are not routinely doneAside
from architectural compatibility, one key to determining
the potential for creating a multipurpose
exercise area is to do a realistic schedule of all
activities and to determine the needs and numbers
of persons using the activityFuture needs
must also be considered 
Environmental considerations
Issue: Sound quality in, and noise transmission
from, exercise areas should be controlled 
Response: The level of sound in an indoor
exercise area can prevent people from communicating
effectivelyCommunication via
intercom systems can be obscured because
of echoes created by hard surfacesThis
sound problem can be mitigated by using
acoustic treatments and/or sound-absorbing
floor surfacesCarpet or other applied resilient
floorings can be used in place of bare
concrete 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Given that exercise is a potentially noisy activity,
good sound insulation between areas is particularly
helpful when the exercise area is adjacent
to housing, visiting, counseling, and control
functions 
Outdoor Exercise
The following detailed functional-architectural
issues apply to outdoor exercise: activities, security,
and fire safety 
Activities
Issue: Plan to use outdoor exercise areas in
cold and inclement weather 
Response: Damp or cold weather will not
necessarily eliminate inmates’ desire to get
some fresh air or sunlightTherefore, a facility
should be prepared to issue appropriate
clothing—gloves, sweatshirts, jackets, foul
weather footwear, and hatsProper space
for storage and distribution of these items
should then be provided 
Security
Issue: Special attention should be given to
controlling escape attempts 
Response: Experience and research both
show that escape risks are high with
outdoor exerciseUsing solid, securityconstructed
walls and installing a sturdy,
tightly woven screen or mesh over outdoor
areas will help solve security problems
while still allowing the introduction of fresh
air and sunlight 
Blind spots should be eliminated wherever possible,
and drain covers, fixtures, and other items
that can be dislodged and used as tools to aid in
an escape attempt should be securely fastened 
To help solve staff surveillance problems, locate
outdoor areas where they can be seen from a
constantly staffed postLocating outdoor exercise
areas adjacent to housing units and providing
views from the staff workstation into the exercise
area can also provide an additional level of security 
CCTV monitoring in lieu of staff surveillance
or supervision fails to provide the necessary
ability to detect and respond to escape attempts
and fights between inmatesTo allow control and
surveillance of the area at all times, whether or
not it is being used, consider providing artificial
lighting for the area 
Issue: Special attention should be given to controlling
contraband passage 
Response: The passage of weapons, drugs,
messages, and other contraband to inmates
by outsiders can be controlled through a
combination of operational and architectural
meansOperationally, staff should check the
exercise area for contraband before, after,
and during exercise periodsArchitecturally,
the same techniques noted as ways to control
escape attempts should be considered 
Another idea would be to surround the
Mesh-covered outdoor exercise area 
(Photograph courtesy of Jim Rowenhorst )
 
C h a p t e r :
E x e r c i s e A r e a s
exercise area by the building itself, thereby
making it less noticeable and accessible to
outsiders (exhibit ) 
A special security concern arises when work
release and/or inmate workers use the same
activity space as the general inmate population,
regardless of whether that space is outdoors or
indoorsThere is a potential for contraband passage
by prior arrangement that must be managed
by searches of the space and the inmates 
Another physical detail to control is drainage 
Openings in walls for exercise area drainage or
snow removal can provide a natural route for
contraband passage if they are adjacent to public
areas and are not properly screened or protected 
Issue: Outside view and voice contact between
the public and inmates should be controlled 
Response: Although the use of high, solid
walls eliminates direct public view of and
conversation with exercising inmates, total
isolation of sound is nearly impossibleIn
heavily populated areas, such as jails built
in city centers, placing the outdoor area(s)
toward the back of the facility can help control
random public/inmate sound transmission 
Constructing rooftop exercise areas to
minimize contact problems is discouraged
because additional movement problems,
staff requirements, and snow removal and
drainage problems can result

Programs and Services
Avariety of programs and services can be
provided to enhance staff management
capabilities and fulfill the mission of the
facility, whether that focuses on restraint, reintegration,
reform, or rehabilitationSome programs
and services, such as religious services and legal
library resources, are required by state standards
and court decisions 
Thisaddresses Key Decisions
The following decisions should be made as the
role of the programs and services component is
evaluated, because these decisions have a fundamental
effect on design requirements:
 Which programs and services will be provided
(consistent with the facility’s mission and state
standards)?
 How frequently will they be provided, and
to whom?
 To what extent will outside resources be used,
whether it is service providers coming to the
jail or inmates going out to the services?
 Will the nature and frequency of selected
programs and services permit use of a multipurpose
space? What programs and services
should not occur in the same space because
of security, functional, or environmental
conflicts?
 Will small-scale, passive recreational programming
be provided? If so, will this recreation occur
in the housing areas and will it be in lieu
of vigorous indoor exercise or in addition to it?
Detail Issues
The detailed functional-architectural issues that
are most crucial to the inmate programs and
services component are discussed here

General
issues that seem applicable to all of the programs
and services are discussed first, including the
multipurpose concept and the compatibility issues
that surround itIssues relevant to individual
programs or services are then addressed 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
General Issues
The following issues apply generally to the
inmate programs and services component:
location/users, separation/supervision, quality,
security, and multipurpose possibilities 
Location/users
Issue: The location of program and service components
should facilitate proper surveillance
and supervision, effective functioning, and access
for service providers 
Response: A consistent characteristic of
inmate program and service spaces is that
outside service providers will use the spaces
in conjunction with the inmatesThis suggests
several general principles about the location
of inmate program and service areas:
 They should be easily accessible
through a secure vestibule entry
through the security envelope of the
jail to ensure control of all movement
into the jail 
 Service providers, who are not jail
staff, should have a background investigation
and be cleared through
a metal detector before entering any
area accessed by inmates 
 If possible, the inmate program and
service areas should be observable
from a constantly staffed post without
violating the privacy required by the
function, service, or program taking
placeMinimally, officers should conduct
routine security rounds in program
areas 
 Program and service areas should be
sufficiently isolated from significant
noise generated by movement within
the jail or other activities (e g , mechanical
areas, indoor or outdoor exercise
areas, kitchen, and laundry) 
Separation/supervision
Issue: Separation requirements and supervision
methods for program functions will affect the
need for space 
Response: Separation criteria for program
and service functions may be quite different
from those for the housing areasThe
degree to which separation requirements
are minimized depends a great deal on the
method of supervision, the nature of the activity,
and the duration of the activity 
Depending on pertinent standards, it may be
that both mediumand low-security adult male
inmates, and even selected adult female inmates,
may jointly participate in a substance abuse
counseling program or in religious servicesThis
possibility increases if program staff are present
at all times during the event and the space
is under observation by a security officerSuch
merging of inmate groups reduces scheduling demands
on the space and the possibility that more
than one space will be neededConversely, if

C h a p t e r :
P r o g r a m s a n d S e r v i c e s
an activity such as recreation were to take place
without constant and direct supervision by staff
or even observation from a remote post, it would
be best to maintain the same separations used in
housing 
Quality
Issue: The quality of the program and service
area environment should reinforce and complement
the activities 
Response: The following considerations generally
apply to inmate program and service
areas:
 Visual privacy from activity and movement
in adjacent spaces that might
distract program participants or detract
from the activity at hand 
 Acoustic privacy through the use of
ceiling treatments, carpeting, insulated
walls, and other techniques that
improve sound quality and minimize
sound transfer from other activities
and functions 
 The introduction of natural light 
 Adequate artificial light for particular
activities, including some ability to
control and vary light levels and focus 
 Pleasant and comfortable surroundings
in general 
Security
Issue: Inmate program and service areas should
be provided with adequate security 
Response: Even though inmate programs
and services are generally considered benefits
that might elicit positive inmate behavior,
the fundamental security of the areas
should not be compromised in any wayIn
essence, these areas should be developed
much like any other secured area in the jail 
The only exception would be program, job
training, or reentry facilities in a minimumsecurity
settingFollowing are some
considerations:
 Regardless of the interior treatment of
the program spaces, the perimeter of
the area—especially when it includes
exterior walls—must be as secure as
any other portion of the building 
 Windows to the exterior should have
the same security design elements
as any other exterior window in the
facility, although the narrow slits of
glazing preferred for cells may be unnecessary
in directly supervised program
areasView conflicts should be
minimized 
 Program and service area interiors ideally
should be visible from a constantly
staffed postAt a minimum, roving
staff should be able to view interiors
from adjacent corridors 
 Staff and service providers working
with inmates should be able to communicate
directly with staff at a fixed
postA two-way intercom would be
appropriate for this purpose(In some
cases, service providers are given a
panic alarm to activate in case of an
emergency )
 In cases where direct observation is
not possible, closed-circuit television
(CCTV) should be considered but
never relied on as the sole means of
surveillance 
Generally, CCTV monitoring of counseling and
interview spaces is permissibleHowever, it
should be as unobtrusive as possible and should
not hinder communication between participants 
Under no circumstances should staff be able to
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
monitor, either by audio or visually, privileged
communications between inmates and legal
counsel or clergyIn some states, inmates’ consultations
with legal counsel are to be out of
view of all staff 
Multipurpose possibilities
Issue: Multipurpose space sharing for inmate
programs and services is desirable as long as
schedules do not conflict and functions are
compatible 
Response: The relative flexibility in scheduling
that is common when planning for
programs and services provides an opportunity
to save space through the creation of
a multipurpose program spaceHowever, it
cannot be automatically assumed that one
or several multipurpose spaces will meet all
demandsSeveral important considerations
must be taken into account when assessing
the extent to which a multipurpose space
suits the program and service needs of a
jail, notably, schedule, flexibility, and
compatibility 
ScheduleThe schedule of activities is critical in
assessing multipurpose potentialThe planner
must identify each program or service that will
take place now and potentially in the future, and
the frequency and duration of each activityThis
information should be charted to determine the
extent of the demand for programs and services 
Predicting demand can be difficult if very few
programs are available to inmates in the current
facility; talking with staff at other facilities can
help planners project the demand for various programs 
Additionally, the schedule should reflect
when programs and services will occurFor example,
most programs and services may be in the
evening hours for the convenience of outside service
providers, thereby precluding use of a single
multipurpose space 
FlexibilityThe flexibility of the multipurpose
space is crucialThe space must be able to accommodate
the different furniture and equipment
needs of each of the programs or services to take
place thereFor example, tables needed for table
tennis are not appropriate for religious services,
so they must be moved out of the wayMoveable,
foldable, and/or stackable furniture is essential
for a multipurpose spaceIn addition, ample storage
space for equipment and supplies adjacent to
a multipurpose area is critical (exhibit ) 
Flexibility also includes being able to adapt the
fundamental character of the spaceFor example,
it is valuable to provide acoustically effective
foldable or removable partitions in a large multipurpose
room to allow the size and character
of the space to change as the functions and
their needs changeThis flexibility could allow
for more than one group to use the space at the
same time 
Another important flexibility consideration is
the amount of time it takes to move furniture
and change the character of the space to accommodate
another functionSuch setup time might
be a critical factor in the scheduling of activities
and the determination of whether a multipurpose
space can accommodate as many functions as
originally thoughtA good example of a potential
setup problem occurs when the dining function is
merged with a multipurpose space functionThe
time it takes to clean the area after meals, move
tables and chairs out of the way, and reset that

furniture three times a day creates considerable
problems in terms of having adequate time to accommodate
other functions in the multipurpose
spaceFlexibility also means providing accommodations
for varied lighting needs, environmental
needs, and equipment needs (audiovisual equipment,
screens, etc ) 
CompatibilityThe fundamental compatibility of
the various programs and services targeted for
a multipurpose space must be closely assessed 
It is possible that saving space by combining as
many functions as possible in one or two areas
would compromise the effectiveness or security
of some functions 
Library carrels/reading areaCompatibility depends
on the degree to which normally cumbersome
study carrels can be moved out of the
way during other activities and on the degree to
which they contain equipment (such as computers,
CD players, and audio equipment used in
training), which should be protected from inmates
during other activities 
Court hearingsIf holding court hearings at the
facility is a common occurrence, dedicated courtroom
space should be provided to accommodate
all parties to the proceedingsHowever, if court
hearings within the facility are rare, steps can be
taken to use a multipurpose space for this activity 
Compatibility depends on the proper location
of the space so that participants from the general
public and court personnel can gain access without
penetrating the inmate-occupied areas of the
jailAnother consideration is the need for furniture
and equipment to serve court purposes, such
as a judge’s bench, podiums, microphones and
electronic gear, and a court reporter’s desk 
The need for the public and legal personnel to
move through a secure entry vestibule to court
functions is another considerationSuch a secure
entry would be required if the court hearing
room had a multipurpose capability that involved
inmate programs and services 
If court hearings are limited to video arraignments
or first appearances, there is no incompatibility
with the multipurpose room as long as
equipment can be stored and/or securedEquipment
would include a television (TV) monitor,
camera, and microphone setup for the inmate,
supervising officer, and, perhaps, an attorney 
Some functions seem clearly incompatible with
other functions and therefore should not be conducted
in the same multipurpose space: dining,
indoor exercise, individual counseling, and contact
visiting 
DiningThe dining function seems minimally
compatible with any of the other programs and
services listed, owing to the problems of dedicating
the space for dining three times a day, the
cleanup and setup time involved, and general
concern about odors and sanitation

F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Indoor exerciseThe scale, acoustics, equipment,
and the vigorous activity associated with indoor
exercise spaces, particularly those that accommodate
such activities as basketball and volleyball,
are fundamentally incompatible with the characteristics
and needs of other inmate programs and
services 
Individual counselingIndividual counseling
spaces are intended for one-on-one counseling
sessionsSpaces that are overly large, inadequately
private, or subject to distraction should
not be used as counseling rooms if at all possible 
However, individual counseling rooms may be
included adjacent to the multipurpose area
(exhibit ) 
Contact visitingConcern over the possibilities
of contraband passage and the need to keep the
general public out of the jail security envelope
whenever possible suggests that contact visiting
should not be merged with a multipurpose function
if it can be avoidedRather, contact visiting
should occur in a controlled area just outside the

of visiting areas is available in 
Counseling
Counseling can be a valuable service to the inmate,
the facility, and the communityCounseling
services can help inmates deal with the tension
and anxiety of their situation, aid them in adjusting
to jail life, and assist them in controlling
chronic personal problemsCounseling activities
can include crisis intervention and help in dealing
with substance abuse; family, religious, and
educational issues; and employmentCounseling
is also used to help orient new inmates to the
rules and practices of the facility 
Counseling space types
Issue: The nature of counseling activities should be
identified to determine the type of space required

C h a p t e r :
P r o g r a m s a n d S e r v i c e s
Response: Two fundamentally different types
of counseling potentially involve different
demands for spaceOne is individual counseling,
which is a one-on-one experience
between the inmate and the counselorThe
other is group counseling, which usually
involves a counselor and two or more inmates 
Group sessions are most common
in substance abuse counselingIdeally,
individual counseling will occur in spaces
separate from group counselingGroup
counseling, by its nature, is much more
compatible with a multipurpose space than
is individual counselingIndividual counseling
is more compatible with smaller scale
spaces suitable for attorney-client visiting or
contact visiting 
Counseling space size
Issue: The size of counseling spaces depends
on the number of participants 
Response: Spaces for individual, one-onone
counseling should be a minimum of
approximatelysquare feet to allow for
some comfort and avoid too great a sense
of confinementIf the space cannot be provided
with natural light and the sense of
extended space that a window tends to provide,
increasing the size of the space might
be desirable 
The following rules of thumb might be useful for
planning the size of group counseling spaces:
 Three to four persons: square feet 
 Five or more persons: square feet plus
anothersquare feet for the fifth and each
additional person 
Group counseling spaces should be properly proportioned 
A nearly square space provides considerable
flexibility in allowing the counselor to
create group settings that focus activities
appropriately 
If a large multipurpose space that is longer and
narrower than desirable must be used, the use of
folding, moveable partitions may help attain the
proper size and proportions for group counseling
sessions 
Number of counseling spaces
Issue: The number of individual and group
counseling spaces required depends on the
frequency of use, the duration of use, and the
scheduling of staff 
Response: Scheduling may be the key to determining
the number of counseling spaces
needed; for example, if two or more counselors
must come at the same time of day,
more than one space needs to be available 
The need to provide dedicated individual
counseling spaces may be served by the use
of attorney-client or contact visiting spaces 
This also depends on frequency of use,
scheduling, and other compatibility factors
discussed earlier 
If separate counseling space cannot be provided,
another possibility for individual counseling is to
use the office space provided for program staff
within the security perimeter that can be monitored
by security staffFor example, a work space
provided for counselors could double as a counseling
area if properly designed and if privacy
can be guaranteedProper design involves having
sufficient space to accommodate the counselor
and the inmate in a proper setting separate from
the work areaIt also involves the ability to secure
items that could be considered contraband
if possessed by an inmate (for example, desk
items)Counseling should not be planned for a
shared office to which two or more staff need
access at the same time

F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Characteristics of counseling spaces
Issue: The characteristics of counseling spaces
should complement the needs and the security
of the activity 
Response: Several characteristics of counseling
spaces should be considered:
 All counseling spaces should be comfortable,
quiet, private, and minimally
affected by outside distractions 
 Counseling spaces should have comfortable
seatingIt is helpful if the
furniture is moveable so it can be arranged
in a fashion most conducive to
successful counseling 
 Natural light is beneficial but should
be controlled to prevent unnecessary
distractions from outside activities 
It should also be provided through a
securely designed window, skylight,
or clerestoryNatural light improves
the quality of the area and, with a
window, provides some spatial relief,
which tends to relax the inmate 
 Counseling spaces should be observable
from a constantly staffed post if
possible, but not overexposedPrivacy
for counseling is critical to eliciting
proper inmate participationSmall vision
panels or partially screened or
shuttered openings are more appropriate
than expansive vision panels fully
exposing the counseling activity to
officers or inmates outside the space 
A two-way intercom within the space
can be a valuable aid to ensuring the
counselor’s safety 
 Often in direct supervision or remote
supervision housing units, counseling
spaces are built off the main dayroom
area, within the housing unitBringing
services to the unit decreases the need
to move inmates to counseling and
allows for proper supervision 
Religious Services
Issue: Religious services must be accommodated 
Response: Accommodation of religious
expression by the inmate population is a
required part of the programs and services
offered at a jailProviding access to religious
activities may include:
 Counseling on a one-to-one basis 
 Small group instruction (e g , Bible
study) anytime during the week 
 (exhibit
) 
Consideration should be given to the design
impact of special religious activities, such as
 
C h a p t e r :
P r o g r a m s a n d S e r v i c e s
confessions or baptisms, if they are to be accommodated 
Typically, confession requires private
booths that allow a priest and the inmate to
communicate quietly, while seated, through a
heavily veiled openingSuch a need might be accommodated
by designing a confessional space
within the facility or by creating a portable booth
that can be stored in an adjacent multipurpose
storage area when not in useRaised platforms
for an altar area may be similarly portable 
As a rule of thumb,square feet per user
should be provided for religious services, exclusive
of the area from which the cleric speaks 
Library Services
Libraries supply inmates with needed access to
legal materials as well as recreational reading
that can help them prepare for vocations, enlarge
their social and educational backgrounds, and
support facility management 
Library activities
Issue: The extent of library activities must be
determined to provide proper space 
Altar
Skylight with
security barrier
Door

E x h i b i t Altar Area That Can Be Closed Off
During Nonreligious Activities
Response: Both fundamental library activities
and optional activities greatly influence
the size of the jail libraryThe basic purpose
of a library in any jail is to store books,
periodicals, and newspapers supplied by
the facility for inmate useOther activities
associated with a basic library function include
keeping records of books checked out
and distributing, sorting, maintaining, and
shelving library items as they are returned 
Several optional library activities that might be
part of the jail program also affect space and
equipment needsThey include:
 Maintaining a law library collection or computer
access to one (outside sources may also
be a viable method of providing inmates with
access to legal materials) 
 Reading and studying 
 Writing and preparing documents 
 Displaying notices and information about library
materials and activities 
 Maintaining and using audiovisual equipment,
including CDs and DVDs 
 Providing reading and study carrels, with support
audiovisual equipment 
Most of these optional activities operate on the
basic assumption that some or all of the inmates
will go to the library to browse through materials,
use them in the library, and/or check them
outHowever, many jails maintain only sufficient
space to store books and the carts with which
books are delivered to inmatesIn this delivery
scenario, inmates identify the books they want
from a list of available materials and staff later
fill their requests, or carts are assigned to the
housing units and stocked with new books on a
scheduled basisStorage of library materials in
a multipurpose space tends to provide the jail

Library size
Issue: Space needs must be determined by library
activities and storage requirements 
Response: The size of a library space depends
primarily on the activities that occur
and the types and number of books and
materials storedRegarding the number of
books, it is recommended that smaller jails
provide roughlybooks per bed and at
least magazine and local, state, or national
newspaper per everyresidentsIn
larger jails, the number and types of books
and periodicals provided to inmates could
be significantly larger 
The following formula applies for calculating
space for book storage (stack) areas:
Using this formula, a, -volume library ( 
beds ×volumes per bed) would require approximately
square feet of stack area exclusive
of general circulation in the larger library
space 
Total
volumes = Required square footage
for stacks

If provided, a reading area should be calculated
as follows:
% of bed capacity ×square feet = reading
area square footage
By this formula, a-bed facility would need to
provide square feet of reading area exclusive
of general circulation in the library
Additional area should be considered when fixed
study carrels and areas for audiovisual equipment
are includedAnother consideration is
space for one or more computer workstations 
For example, complete law libraries are available
on CD-ROM as well as via the InternetThese
computer workstations can also be used for education
courses and training purposesAdditionally,
in facilities where a more elaborate library
is required, consideration should be given to providing
space for a librarian’s office, a paralegal’s
office, a workroom, a checkout area, and a staff
computer terminal 
Library environment
Issue: The quality of the library environment is
important in creating the proper library setting
and preserving library materials 
Response: A library space has some environmental
requirements that differ from those
of other functions, especially those that
These formulas were originally created by the American Correctional Association’s Committee on Institutional Libraries and are
published in Library Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions(Chicago: Association of Specialized and Cooperative Library
Agencies, ) 
 
C h a p t e r :

might be housed in a multipurpose space 
These requirements are most applicable if
the library is made accessible to inmates for
book selection, reading, and studying 
 Artificial light levels should preferably
reachtofootcandles atinches
above the floor surface 
 Humidity levels should be controlled,
preferably within a range of –
percent 
 Temperature should be controlled,
preferably within a range of – degrees
Fahrenheit 
 Acoustic privacy and low reverberation
levels are important to maintaining
the integrity and function of a
library area 
 Some visual privacy is necessary to
reduce distractions, but the space
should be observable from a constantly
staffed post 
Computer workstations in a small jail library

 The space should generally be pleasant
and comfortable 
Multipurpose use of library
Issue: The library function must be compatible
with other functions that may share a multipurpose
space 
Response: The library area poses some difficulty
for a multipurpose operation because
of the inflexible nature of stacking and
storing booksThis is further complicated
if fixed valuable equipment, such as study
carrels and computer workstations, is also
in the space and cannot be moved and/or
must be protected 
One way to prevent stacks from being damaged
during other activities is to put lockable shutters
over themAnother is to locate them at the back
of the room where a moveable partition can be
drawn in front of them during other activities 
Stackable chairs and folding tables in reading
areas also enhance multipurpose capabilities 
Education
Educational programs frequently occur in
even the smallest jailsThe following detailed
functional-architectural issues apply to educational
spaces: size and characteristics 
Size
Issue: The size of educational facilities depends
on the types of programs offered and the number
of participants 
Response: Even though jails can benefit
from offering educational programs to inmates,
it can be the case that inmates in
jails do not stay long enough to participate
in extended programsConsequently, true
need should be ascertained to determine
whether a space as great as a dedicated
classroom should be provided for educational
programsIn larger facilities, several
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
classrooms may be necessary to accommodate
the educational opportunities available
to the inmates 
Many educational programs consist of tutoring
or work toward a general equivalency diploma
(GED) with a teacher or volunteer working
with a small number of studentsFor these applications,
an individual counseling space or an
attorney-client visiting space may be an adequate
alternative to providing a dedicated space if no
schedule conflicts occurHowever, spaces used
for tutoring or educational programs involving
several inmates at one time should have marker
boards, chalkboards, and/or other implements
that aid in the teaching process 
Special space needs may arise depending on the
nature of the educational program offeredFor
example, some jail educational programs involve
independent study via audiovisual equipment or
computers for e-learning placed in fixed study
carrels or table areasThis approach to education
requires space for the carrel or table and the
equipment as well as supervision and supplemental
instruction by educational staffSuch a
program should not only have dedicated space
for the equipment, but should be located where
monitoring capability is available 
One form of educational program that is unusual
for smaller jails but common in larger jails is
vocational trainingPrograms involving cooking,
auto repair, carpentry, or other specialized activities
could have a dramatic impact on space and
equipment needsMany times special buildings
are constructed specifically for these vocational
training programs to accommodate special equipment
and training space 
Educational space characteristics
Issue: Educational spaces should be designed
to complement the various activities that might
take place 
Response: For educational space to function
effectively, some general characteristics
should be attainedThese apply especially
to educational spaces for teaching inmates
in groups rather than individually:
 Equipment/furnishings:

 Environment:
Proper acoustic separation from noisegenerating
areas 
Good ventilation and controlled
temperature 
– footcandles of artificial light 
inches above the floor surface 
Artificial light that provides options for
intensity to accommodate a wide range of
activities (verbal instruction, slide shows
with note-taking, films, etc ) 
Natural light, if possible 
Recreation
Recreation differs from indoor exercise in that
recreational activities (e g , table tennis, crafts,
painting) are less physical and require considerably
less square footage than indoor exercise 
 
C h a p t e r :
P r o g r a m s a n d S e r v i c e s
Issue: Recreational activity needs must be identified
to specify space requirements 
Response: Recreational needs may greatly
influence the size and shape of the multipurpose
space if recreation is to take place
in such an areaThe dimensional requirements
for an area to accommodate one
or two table tennis games, for example,
can greatly influence the amount of space
needed (exhibit )Often in larger jails
or direct supervision facilities, additional
dayroom space is allocated to accommodate
indoor recreation instead of creating a separate
recreation space 
Recreational programs involving movies with
screens and projectors, or DVDs and TVs, can
generate equipment needs that affect not only the
size of the space but also its orientation and the
need for supplemental storage 
Jail Industries
Although jail industries are primarily viewed as
a large jail or prison activity, some small and,
particularly, medium-sized jails might decide to
implement a jail industry programExamples of
these programs include furniture making or repair,
product packaging, and recycle sortingThe
issue of jail industries should be fully explored
and evaluated during the planning process to assess
the activities involved and the amount and
type of spaces required

Inmate Commissary
An inmate commissary allows inmates to
purchase snacks, supplies, and personal
items not normally supplied by the jail 
Items necessary to basic hygiene (e g , soap, toilet
paper, toothbrush) should be provided by the
facility at no cost 
The inmate commissary is generally viewed as a
privilege, not necessarily a right, as long as basic
hygiene items are provided and food service is
adequate and it is not necessary for the inmates
to supplement facility meals from a commissary 
The trend nationwide is to either provide
commissary services at the jail or use outside
contract sources to manage the commissary operations 
This is done in lieu of allowing friends
or family to bring items to the jail because of the
potential for the introduction of contraband 
Providing inmates with an opportunity to purchase
personal items gives them some control
over their livesIt also provides the jail administration
with an effective management tool for
controlling inmate behavior because the commissary
privilege can be withdrawn for violations of
institutional rulesAdditionally, profits from commissary
operations can be used to provide for or
supplement inmate programs or other services,
supplies, or equipment 
Commissary operations have often been troubled
by problems related to loss control and fiscal
accountabilityHowever, the commissary need
not be a problem as long as secure storage and
proper distribution and accounting procedures
are followed 
To some degree, the decision as to who will manage
the commissary will determine where the
commissary should be locatedAdministration
of the commissary operation can be handled in
many ways and is often assigned to food services
staff, inmate program staff, correctional
officer(s), assigned commissary/warehouse staff,
or contract commissary providers, depending on
the jail’s personnel situation and management
philosophy 
Sound correctional practice and many state standards
require that inmates with funds on account
be provided with an opportunity to purchase discretionary
items not provided by the jailIt is important
to check state standards or statutes with
regard to commissaries, as a few states prohibit
the establishment of petty cash funds or other
such accounts outside the usual county financial
chain of controlSome states require that inmate
funds and profits from commissary operations be
held in trust accounts and used only for the benefit
of the inmates 
Key Decisions
The following decisions have a fundamental effect
on design requirements for a commissary
and should be made when the role of this component
is evaluated:
 What is the anticipated size and scope of
operation?
 Will the commissary role be more broadly
defined to include storage of all basic supplies
for the facility as part of a warehouse area?
 Given the size and scope of the commissary
operation, will the jail rely on an in-house
stock of commissary goods or on a retail outlet
outside the jail (i e , local stores or shops)?
 If the commissary is provided by a contract
service, will the service need space to store
goods and fill orders or will they be delivered
prepackaged to the facility?
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Will commissary goods be brought to the
inmates in their housing units or will the inmates,
as an additional privilege, go to the
commissary to pick up their goods? If the
latter, will all inmates, including those in
maximum security, be allowed to visit the
commissary?
 Who will administer the commissary function,
and who will package the orders? Where will
the accounting and administrative services be
located?
Detail Issues
The following detailed functional-architectural issues
should be considered in the development of
the commissary component: size, location, equipment,
security, and communication 
Size
Issue: The size of the commissary will depend
on the inventory requirements, activities, and
equipment involved in service delivery 
Response: Although commissary and warehouse
activities take a considerable amount
of space in large jail systems, due to the
volume of goods moved through the system
each day, the commissary of a small or
medium-sized jail will typically involve a
relatively small amount of square footage 
However, the amount can vary significantly
depending on the inventory involvedInventory
is affected by the:
 Number of inmates served 
 Range of items offered 
 Amount of each item stocked 
 Type of storage required (dry storage
versus cold and/or frozen) 
A minimal commissary may limit its stock to
candy, snacks, and basic personal hygiene items,
such as shampoo and toothpasteAdditional
items that might be considered include:
 Beverages (tea, coffee, soda) 
 Toiletries in addition to facility issue (deodorant,
soap, hair conditioner, skin lotion) 
 Cleansing tissues, handkerchiefs 
 Radios, batteries 
 Greeting cards, stationery, envelopes, stamps 
 Inmate clothing (underwear, socks, shower
shoes) 
Other factors affecting the size and design of the
commissary relate to activities and equipment,
including:
 The efficiency with which items are stored 
 A refrigerator and/or freezer for soda, ice
cream, and other items that require cold
storage 
 Work surface and seating for staff administering
the commissaryThe work surface should
be large enough to do paperwork on receipts,
request slips, inventories, and order formsIf
the facility uses a computer-based accounting
system, additional surface area for keyboards
and monitors will be requiredA regular staff
workstation or post could be used if the commissary
is managed by regular jail staff 
 If cash is used in transactions, a place for a
secured cash drawer or safeAlternatively, a
separate commissary checking account might
be maintained at a local bank 
 A lockable file cabinet for storage of inmate
commissary accounts, financial records, ordering
information, and other papers 
 
C h a p t e r :
I n m a t e C o m m i s s a r y
 If commissary items are brought to the inmates,
space in which to store a mobile cart,
unless a cart from the kitchen or the health
care area can be borrowed 
 If commissary items are distributed at the commissary
area (i e , inmates go to the commissary),
a securable passthrough windowThis
can be a Dutch door or opening in the wall with
a counterThe counter area should be securable
with a lockable overhead rolling shutter or a
lockable swinging window or door 
 If inmates go to the commissary, an area for a display
cabinet or shelves they can see but not touch

Location
Issue: The location of the commissary depends
on the extent of service, the delivery mode, and
accessibility 
Response: If inmates go to the commissary,
which is most common in minimum
security or work release facilities, it should
be located in an area where a waiting line
does not congest a circulation corridorIt is
also preferable that the area be visible from
a constantly staffed post, thus eliminating
the need for additional escort staff while
the staff member providing service is inside
the commissary roomA view of the commissary
from a staff post is not necessary if
the service is brought to the inmates in their
housing units 
If inmates go to the commissary, it may be useful
to consider affiliating the commissary space
with a multipurpose area (exhibit )In this
way, staff can consolidate two activities in one
movement sequence and share the view control
that would normally be integrated into the design
of a multipurpose areaNo matter the delivery
method, the commissary area should be located
in a secure area near the loading dock or facility
warehouse to allow for ease in accepting deliveries

Equipment
Issue: Determine whether vending machines
will be used to provide commissary items 
Response: Many jails have found that, with
proper supervision, it is possible to permit
inmates to carry small amounts of change,
although it is preferable to offer the ability
for them to purchase debit cards with
unique pin numbersTherefore, it is possible
to run a vending operation as part of
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
the commissary or to locate machines in a
housing area or multipurpose room as long
as they do not interfere with other functions 
It is important to evaluate the vending
machine issue before design to avoid
the placement of machines in inappropriate
locations (e g , in corridors or staff areas to
which inmates must then gain access) 
Security
Issue: Access to the commissary must be strictly
controlled, whether the commissary consists
of a locked storage closet, a separate room, or a
large warehouse 
Response: Security and inventory control
should be attained by limiting access to the
commissary area to essential staff and maintaining
strict key controlThe keys to the
area should only be given to commissary
staff or should be checked out from master
control or the jail administration if there are
not staff dedicated to working in the commissary 
Locating the commissary in an
observable location or an area with limited
access also assists in general security 
Communication
Issue: Communication with master control is
essential 
Response: As with most areas within the
jail, there should be a telephone or intercom
link with master controlThis is particularly
true with a centralized commissary dispensing
location, as the commissary staff will
have to notify housing units when deliveries
are coming 
Space List
Some of the typical spaces that might be found in
the commissary component follow 
 Storage area 
 Work area 
 Inmate waiting area (for centralized
commissary only) 
 Receipt and staging area (for contract
deliveries) 
Local codes and Americans with Disabilities Act
guidelines regarding accessibility requirements
should be consulted when planning these spaces

Food Service
Food service has a major impact on daily jail
operational routines, annual operating costs,
and initial construction costsIt presents
many security concerns, is a regular disruption to
other jail operations and supervision needs, and
is a major factor affecting inmate attitudes and
behaviorThe quantity and quality of food and
the means of preparing and serving it have often
been at issue in inmate grievances and lawsuits 
In these instances, inadequate documentation of
meal planning or difficulties maintaining equipment
to current standards for institutional food
service can become very troublesome for jail
administrators 
Constructing sufficient work space and providing
adequate storage areas and equipment to respond
to inmate dietary needs can be quite expensive
and make a substantial dent in the normally limited
jail construction budgetThus, careful consideration
must be given to how food service will
be implemented 
Food service encompasses a variety of basic
activities:
 Menu planning and food ordering 
 Receiving and storing foods and related
supplies 
 Food/beverage preparation 
 Food/beverage delivery 
 Inmate dining (in those facilities that wish to
have a centralized dining area) 
 Staff dining (all facilities should provide an
area outside the housing areas or control
rooms in which staff members can take breaks
and eat their meals) 
 Cleanup and dishwashing after meals 
 Disposal of waste 
 Record keeping 
Full service kitchen in a small jail 
(Photograph courtesy of Jim Rowenhorst )
The design of jail food service areas should focus
on providing quality facilities that minimize food
preparation time, enhance the ease of delivery
without compromising food quality, and accommodate
future capacity needs without requiring
later expansion of food service areasThe character
of the food service area and the materials
and finishes used are similar to those used in
conventional institutional kitchens, with the exception
that perimeter and internal security must
be provided 
American Correctional Association standards
focus primarily on policies, procedures, and
documentation of an inmate food service operation 
Besides requiring three meals per day, these
standards are aimed primarily toward ensuring
the dietary and hygienic adequacy of a jail food
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
service operationThey do not attempt to dictate
specifically how that service is to be provided 
State and local food service and public health
requirements should be checked carefullyMost
state and local jurisdictions have health department
and sanitation codes regarding the preparation
and handling of food and the disposal
of food waste productsThese state and local
requirements define a minimum operational
level that must be met at all local food service
facilitiesMost state jail standards also address
requirements for jail food service 
Key Decisions
The following decisions have a fundamental effect
on design requirements and therefore should
be made when the role of the food service component
is evaluated:
 Will food be prepared at the facility or be
provided by outside sources such as a central
kitchen serving several facilities, local schools,
or hospitals? Or, will “easy” cold meals such as
breakfast cereal or lunch sandwiches be prepared
at the jail and hot meals come from an
outside source?
 If meals are provided by an outside source,
what facilities and equipment will be required
at the jail to serve the meals? Will the meals
have to be reheated in a retherm kitchen? Will
meals items arrive in bulk or already on trays?
 Will inmate dining occur at a central dining
area or within the housing units? If at a central
dining area, will all inmates, regardless of classification,
use the facilities? If at the housing
units, what method of food delivery will be
used to ensure that proper food temperatures
and quality are maintained?
 How frequently will food supplies be ordered,
and what effect does this have on storage
needs?
 Will minimum-security inmate workers be
available to assist in food service operations
and, if so, to what extent?
 How will food service facilities be designed
to accommodate future expanded inmate
capacities?
Detail Issues
The following detailed functional-architectural
issues should be considered in the development
of the food services component: the food service
provider, the location of inmate dining, food
preparation and storage, cleanup and waste handling,
food delivery, staff accommodations, security,
inmate workers, and the staff dining area 
Food Service Provider
Issue: A choice must be made between providing
food services in-house (either using jail staff
or a food service vendor) or contracting for food
service from outside sources 
Response: Some smaller jails use an outside
food service source that will prepare meals
at its own facilities and transport them to
the jailBringing in food from the outside is
generally not done in larger facilities due to
the volume of meals served and issues with
transportation and maintaining food temperatures 
Bringing in food from the outside
can be done through a private food service
company or restaurant or a nearby institution,
such as a hospital, nursing home, or
schoolAlthough this method poses several
potential problems, comparing long-term
costs and evaluating operational concerns
could prove worthwhile 
The primary advantages of using outside sources
include:
 
C h a p t e r :
F o o d S e r v i c e
 Eliminating the floor area required for kitchen
and food storage from construction costs 
 Eliminating food service equipment from
initial project costs 
 Reducing the overall mechanical and electrical
load requirements of the building 
 Simplifying operational purchasing and maintenance
needs 
 Eliminating costs for cooking staff 
 Eliminating periodic costs for repair or replacement
of obsolete kitchen equipment 
 Eliminating kitchen cutlery from the secure
jail area 
Some potential disadvantages of using outside
sources include:
 Attempts to conceal contraband in food trays
and carts brought to the jail 
 Increased security staff time involving movement
of food into and out of the jail security
perimeter 
 Possible inability to add efficient kitchen space
to the building if the contracting service must
be abandoned 
 Lack of control over escalating contract costs 
 Potential operational difficulties if the contract
service temporarily shuts down (e g , schools
during summer vacation, facilities during
renovations) 
 Possible need for equipment for backup cooking,
warmup, or delivery 
 Possible need for dishwashing/cleaning
equipment 
In an ideal situation, the outside food service
source would provide the following items to reduce
staff work and facility space needs:
 Meals that are preplated in disposable or reusable
insulated trays with meal temperature
adequately maintained in transit 
 Cups and utensils that are either disposable or
returned to the provider for cleaning 
 Beverages in insulated containers that can be
used for dispensing and returned to the provider
for cleaning 
 Delivery carts 
If any or all of these elements are missing, they
must be provided and accommodated at the jail,
implying the need for a fairly significant amount of
space and equipment, although still not as much
as a full kitchen with full storage capabilities 
It is also important to create a secure method of
receiving the food from an outside providerThis
point of entry should be configured and operate
as a security vestibule because it represents a
penetration of the security perimeter of the jail 
In-House Food Service
If food services are to be provided in-house, the
primary operational concerns would focus on the
potential use of inmate workers and, therefore,
whether food service staff would have supervision
and security responsibilities in addition to
meal preparation and cleanup 
Kitchen activities require cutlery and other equipment
that could become weaponsWhere inmate
workers will assist in food preparation and
cleanup, special precautions for food delivery,
trash removal, inventory control, and the location
of inmate worker housing must be considered 
Also, when inmate workers are used, there is the
question of whether food service staff must be
trained to provide inmate supervision or whether
intermittent or electronic monitoring by other jail
staff will be adequate 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Other tasks associated with food service include
menu planning, food purchasing, and maintaining
food service recordsThe design considerations
for these tasks are discussed in the
functional issues to follow 
Location of Inmate Dining
Issue: The location of inmate dining and the
method of food delivery must be established 
Response: Dining can be centralized or
decentralized 
Centralized dining
A centralized dining area has the potential advantage
of using a serving line and dining space
adjacent to the kitchenThis location eliminates
the need for tray assembly time and food carts,
provides the quickest delivery of hot foods, and
simplifies cleanup (exhibit ) 
Unfortunately, this method of dining creates a
number of major operational problems, especially
in facilities that house all classifications
of inmatesMaintaining the separation of different
housing classifications during mealtime can
prolong food service times with many groups of
inmates in the dining area at different timesIf
central dining takes place in a general multipurpose
room rather than a designated dining area,
E x h i b i t Centralized Dining Area Adjacent

line
Kitchen
the time needed for food service and cleanup
would likely eliminate most other activity uses
in that areaMoving groups of inmates to and
from dining three times a day substantially increases
staff monitoring responsibilities and
could require more supervisory personnel 
Inmate movement to and from dining could severely
restrict other jail activities for prolonged
periods of time while the different inmate classification
groups are allowed to eat, the area is
cleaned, and the next group brought inConsequently,
central dining in a multipurpose room is
generally discouraged, especially when sanitation
issues are also considered 
Decentralized dining
Decentralized dining, which involves moving
prepared food trays in carts to the various housing
pods, is the most common method of inmate
diningInmates eat at dayroom tables and are
monitored by the housing area security staffThis
tends to facilitate dining with minimal movement
and security problems

C h a p t e r :
F o o d S e r v i c e
Two classic problems with dining within housing
units have been (l) insufficient space for rapidly
and effectively distributing meals, including
drinks, and ( ) maintaining proper food temperature 
The most common response to these issues
is the use of thermal trays designed to maintain
food at a proper temperature for extended
periods of timeThermal trays can be brought
into the housing unit on carts and distributed 
Planners should include a tray and beverage
service station in each housing area to facilitate
this process 
Another response to these problems is to complete
the tray assembly process in the housing
unitsAs an example, bulk food containers are
set up in each housing unit or general housing
area for final tray assembly, in some cases employing
a cafeteria-style serving lineIn some instances,
microwave heating units located in each
housing unit or in the general housing area are
used to reheat entrees to an optimal temperature 
Cafeteria-style food service also requires an area
in the housing unit to line up the bulk food containers
and distribute and collect the trays 
Other alternatives to consider are to provide thermally
controlled carts for the traysThese carts
can be brought to the housing units and plugged
in to maintain the temperature of hot and cold
itemsSome facilities use cook-chill systems and
provide retherm units in the housing areas to
heat the meals so there is no problem maintaining
meal temperaturesWith this system, food is
prepared in advance, then trays are assembled
and placed in a blast chiller to cool to the proper
storage temperatureWhen the food is to be
served, the trays are placed in a retherm unit and
distributed to the inmates either from a central
location or in the housing area 
With the conventional approach of preparing
food trays at the food service area and delivering
them to the inmate housing units, the following
considerations apply:
Cook-chill cooking and bagging system 
(Photograph courtesy of Voorhis Robertson Justice Services )
 Providing sufficient surface area or tray assembly
equipment (such as assembly lines) to
allow rapid tray assembly and preparation for
insulated delivery 
Providing storage and cleaning areas for carts
used in delivery 
Coordinating the food tray size with the size
of food passthroughs used to serve inmates
when they must eat in their cells (e g , disciplinary
detention) 
Providing food passthroughs into the dayrooms
to allow serving the meal in higher
security units without opening the door 
Providing a means to distribute beverages
effectively (e g , fill cups and distribute
through a food pass or place a large beverage
dispenser in the housing unit for inmates to
serve themselves) 
Providing a means by which to count, distribute,
collect, and recount utensils, trays, and
cups 





 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Providing a means by which to collect waste
(everything returned on the tray, or a waste
can in housing units for later collection) 
Food Preparation and Storage
Issue: Food preparation and storage area size
and layout should be adequate to allow for the
efficient preparation and assembly of meals 
Response: The sizes of the food preparation
and storage areas are influenced by five primary
factors:
 Types of meals prepared 
 Storage capacity 
 Flow/efficiency 
 Tray assembly approach 
 Expansion capabilities 
Size is determined as much by the type of food
to be prepared as by the number of meals to be
servedBuying bulk commodities and fresh produce
increases the storage requirements for
Dry storage area in a small jail kitchen 
(Photograph courtesy of Jim Rowenhorst )
a kitchen and frequently requires more equipment
(e g , refrigerators, slicer, vegetable shredders,
bread ovens)Retaining the services of a
dietitian and a food service consultant during the
facility planning stages can assist in developing
and coordinating menus with food purchasing options
and required food preparation equipment 
The design of the kitchen should emphasize efficient
production and assembly of food from
storage to preparation, cooking, and servingThis
production flow for food preparation should be
reflected in the design layout and should minimize
cross traffic patterns for maximum efficiency
(exhibit ) 
Special consideration should be given to convenient
tray assembly procedures, a typical problem
in many jail kitchensAmple work surfaces on
which to place the trays prior to placement on a
cart, or the provision of a conveyor belt assembly
line for rapid tray assembly and immediate placement
on a cart, are practical solutions to this
problemIt should be noted, however, that tray
assembly systems sometimes require numbers of
inmate workers or staff that may not be available
in a smaller jail 
Deciding on the size of the kitchen should also
include consideration of future expansion of bed
capacityAlthough kitchen spaces can be located
along an exterior wall to allow expansion, this

is sometimes an impractical alternative, given
frequently limited growth needs and the disruption
to existing equipment and functional space
arrangements that must operate during renovation
(preparation areas, cooking areas, tray assembly
areas, dishwashing areas)Oversizing the kitchen
and storage areas for a future expanded capacity
usually requires only a modest increase in floor
area and provides the operators with welcome
initial flexibility in storage and work areas 
In determining the size of the food service area,
consideration should be given to providing meals
to other facilities (e g , local juvenile detention
and detoxification facilities)Some jurisdictions
have consolidated the food service areas of one
or more facilities in the new jailCost savings are
realized by eliminating duplication of facilities,
equipment, maintenance, and cooking staff and
by reducing food purchase costs by buying larger
quantities 
Cleanup and Waste Handling
Issue: Adequate provisions must be made for
cleanup and waste handling 
Response: Most health department regulations
require institutional kitchens to
provide specific wash and rinse water temperatures 
These criteria are best met by
institutional dishwashing machinesA professional
food service equipment consultant
can assist in selecting an adequately sized
washer and coordinating related needs for
hot water boosters, grease traps, and so
forth 
The need to wash pots, pans, and cutlery used
in food preparation is similar to that in kitchens
in other facilities and should be accommodated
accordinglyOther cleaning needs can vary widely,
depending largely on whether disposable or
reusable items are usedFor reusable items,
special cleaning equipment (e g , special racks,
deep sinks) may be required because of the
special character of insulated plastic trays, plastic
or metal cups, large insulated beverage dispensers,
etc 
An adequate storage area for trays, utensils, food
carts, and other reusable items should be readily
available near the cleanup and food preparation
areas 
Waste handling considerations include the
following:
 Gathering waste from kitchen and dining
areas 
 Sorting out items for recycling 
 Disposing of food waste 
 Disposing of boxes, cartons, cans, drums 
 Calculating the frequency and volume of trash
removal (perhaps integrated with trash removal
for all facility waste, such as paper and
supplies) 
 Providing a trash compactor, as appropriate 
 Temporarily storing trash until removal can
be securely and conveniently executed, which
may involve ( ) a separate space or area to
contain offensive odors and maintain the
sanitation of the food service area and/or
( ) a waste refrigerator for meat, fat, and fish
scraps 
Food Delivery
Issue: The need to accommodate periodic food
deliveries and use inmates to transfer these
supplies to storage areas can create a weak
point in the jail security perimeter 
Response: The jail should have a delivery
area/loading dock that functions like a security
vestibule (exhibit )Controlled by
master control, food deliveries are unloaded
into this areaBefore the delivery person

leaves, the food service staff verify the contents
of the delivery, weigh items sold by weight,
test the temperature of frozen and chilled
items, and check containers for damage and
contaminationWhen the exterior door is
secured, food service staff coordinate the
transfer of foodstuffs to storage areas by inmate
workers 
In sizing and designing the delivery vestibule/
loading dock, the following issues should be
considered:
 The method of delivery to determine whether
a raised dock or lift is required 
 Temporary storage requirements during
delivery 
 The need to store hand trucks and pallets 
 The type and size of access door(s) needed
(e g , overhead, double swinging) 
It is preferable for the delivery vestibule/loading
dock to be separate from the vehicle sallyport
used for arrestee intake and release so that the
security and availability of that vital area are not
compromised 
Staff Accommodations
Issue: The needs of food service staff should be
accommodated 
Response: The food service director (or chief
cook) should have a work area at which to
prepare menus, document meals served,
and do other paperworkThis area typically
takes the form of an enclosed office space 
It should include, at a minimum, a work
surface; chair; lockable file storage; telephone;
computer terminal; and shelving for
cookbooks, reference sources, manuals, and
catalogs 
Food service staff should be provided with a
locker area for clothing and valuables and toilet
facilities adjacent to the food service areaSeparate
toilet facilities and a break room should be
provided for inmate workersStorage space,
accessible to the food service director, should
be provided for plastic gloves, hairnets, and
other special articles of clothing used by food
preparers 
Security
Issue: Security precautions must be taken if inmates
work in the kitchen 
Response: Cutlery should be regularly inventoried
and stored in a lockable cabinet
or closet with the key securely retained by
the food service director and shift commanders 
Knives should be individually
checked out as needed by kitchen staff and
can be secured to the preparation tables by
lockable tethers before inmates are allowed
access to themTo avoid inmate workers being
pressured by other inmates to smuggle
contraband from the kitchen, most jails
provide a separate housing unit for inmate
workers, which is strongly recommended 
Some jails totally separate that unit from the
 
C h a p t e r :
F o o d S e r v i c e
other housing areas, although care must be
taken not to sacrifice necessary supervision
by doing so(Inmate worker housing and
separation issues are addressed in 
, “Special Housing,” and also in 
 ,“Classification/Separation,” in section )
General security precautions for the kitchen
area should include alarm and/or audio
monitoring—and possibly closed-circuit
television monitoring—by master control
and/or windows at main corridors that permit
staff observationKitchen staff should be able
to easily summon assistance via portable radio,
personal alarm, or panic button 
The food preparation and cleanup areas should
be visible from the food service director’s work
area/office, if possibleAlso, the arrangement
of counters and equipment should minimally
obscure the food service director’s and/or the
security staff’s view, depending on who has the
principal responsibility for directly monitoring
food service area activities 
Inmate Workers
Issue: A dining area for inmate workers may
need to be accommodated as part of the food
service component 
Response:

Laundry Area
The jail laundry should be adequate in size
and contain equipment for the laundering
of bedding, linen, towels, and clothing on
a scheduled basis consistent with standards and
good correctional practiceIn addition, laundry
facilities should provide for cleaning soiled
clothes removed from arrestees at intake 
Laundry facilities in most jails tend to be staffed
by inmate workers responsible for all clothing,
linen, and bedding used in the systemThe work
flow typically follows this pattern: collection,
sorting, washing, drying, folding, mending, storage,
and distribution 
In older jails, laundry areas were often quite
modest, frequently located outside of the security
perimeter in such areas as basements, corridors,
or the sheriff’s residenceThe laundry areas
provided little room in which to work and were
rarely adjacent to key areas, such as the intakerelease
area, or readily observable by jail security
staff 
In newer facilities, laundries tend to be easily
accessible, dedicated laundry spaces that are
used—sometimes on a -hour basis, in large
facilities—to provide inmates with a continuous
supply of clean clothing and beddingCommercial
equipment tends to be preferred over residential
equipment because of its larger capacity
and longer life

Key Decisions
The following decisions have a fundamental effect
on design requirements and should be made
when the role of the laundry services component
is evaluated:
 What range of items will be laundered, and
how frequently?
 Will laundry services be provided in-house or
by outside sources?
 Will inmates assist in laundry operations and,
if so, to what extent?
 How many hours a week will the laundry need
to operate?
 Will any inmate classifications be responsible
for laundering some or all of their own clothing
and linens (e g , work release inmates)?
Will this take place in a separate laundry area?
Detail Issues
The following detailed functional-architectural
issues should be considered in the development
of the laundry component: laundry provider,
security/location, size, work/storage, and characteristics 
Linen and clothing storage issues are
addressed in, “Intake-Release ”
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Laundry Provider
Issue: A choice must be made between providing
laundry services in-house or contracting
with outside sources 
Response: Contracting for laundry services
will slightly reduce overall construction and
project costsThe main advantage to contracting
laundry services is reduced longterm
maintenance and fewer operational
problemsTo determine the best course to
take, a local jurisdiction needs to compare
the savings in construction, equipment,
supplies, and staffing costs with the annual
costs of outside service, the possible
need for extra storage capacity for clothing
and linens (potentially due to less frequent
deliveries and less adaptability to unusual
situations), and the possibility for introduction
of contraband from outside the facility 
Inmate workers are commonly assigned to assist
with laundry services to minimize the cost
and to help justify providing in-house laundry
services (beyond citing the obvious convenience
and control it provides)However, the use of inmate
workers has not been without problems, for
example, inmate use of inappropriate amounts
of detergent or bleach, the premature need to
replace laundry equipment and clothing due to
misuse or vandalism, and difficulties in monitoring
and supervising small groups of inmate
workersThe problem of using incorrect amounts
of detergent and bleach is easily addressed by
planning for secure storage of these items and
automated dispensing directly into the machines
through the use of preprogrammed dispensing
systems 
Another consideration in smaller jails
is the possibility of the jail consistently
having enough inmates who can
be classified for inmate worker status 
Inmate populations can vary widely,
and there may be times when no inmate could be
safely classified for these dutiesThese problems,
when combined, may suggest that a contract
service makes sense, especially if the jail can be
assured that adequate clean clothing and linens
will always be on hand and will be delivered in a
secure fashion 
Security Location
Issue: The laundrymustbelocated soastoensureadequate
security and appropriate access 
Response: When inmate workers help
with laundry services, the laundry must
be within the security envelope of the jail,
which is advisable in any caseBecause the
noise and residual moisture of a laundry
operation can hamper the use of electronic
monitoring devices, it is important to locate
the laundry so that observation of the area
can be maintained from a constantly staffed
post, or at least from outside the space by a
passing officerAdditionally, blind spots in
the arrangement of the equipment should
be minimized or eliminated to facilitate
remote observationTwo-way intercoms
should be provided in the space for communication
between staff and inmate workers 
Ideally, the laundry location should be:
 Adjacent to storage areas for clean facility
clothing and linens and blankets 
 Easily accessible from the housing
units 
 Near or adjacent to inmate worker
housing 
Size
Issue: The size and complexity of the laundry
depend on the frequency of cleaning and the
variety of laundry services offered 
 
C h a p t e r :
L a u n d r y A r e a
Response: A primary determinant of overall
laundry area needs is the frequency with
which items are cleanedMost professional
standards recommend an exchange of clean
clothing, linen, and bedding a minimum of
once each weekThis minimum is exceeded
by many facilities, especially for clothing
and towel serviceFrequent laundry service
can help achieve the goal of good inmate
hygiene and facility cleanliness 
Few older facilities launder street clothing removed
from inmates during intake processing,
although street clothing can present odor, mildew,
and parasite problemsSpray disinfectants
may partially solve these problems, but laundering
is a preferable and effective solution, and its
impact on equipment and space needs should be
considered, even if used for only extremely soiled
clothing 
Other laundry activities that can affect space and
equipment needs include:
 Dry cleaning 
 Garment repair or mending 
 Ironing or pressing 
 Kitchen towel laundering 
 Special laundering (e g , heavily soiled work
uniforms from vocational training or work
programs) 
 Work release laundering 
 Female personal laundering 
To prevent contraband passage, separate laundry
facilities for work release inmates should
be considered (exhibit )These additional
facilities preferably would be part of the work
release housing unit and directly accessible to the
inmatesIt is desirable to place the equipment in
a separate room where moisture and sound can
be better containedThe space should have good
ventilation, a floor drain, and be observable by
staff from a remote point

If work release inmates are not permitted to wear
personal clothing within the security envelope, a
laundry outside the security envelope should be
considered for the laundering of personal clothing
they wear to workThis laundry may contain
coin-operated washers and dryers, and vending

machines for soap and fabric softenerIt should
be located within the facility near the work release
entrance and observable by staff from a
remote point 
Issue: The sizes and types of washers and dryers
depend on the amount and type of laundering
to be done and the number of hours the
laundry will operate 
Response: Except in very small jails, residential
or lightweight commercial machines
are inadequate and insufficiently durable to
handle the variety and amount of laundering
requiredThe daily use of this equipment
and the frequent need to wash heavy loads
such as blankets and shoes generally recommend
the use of heavy-duty, commercialgrade
laundry equipmentTo identify actual
equipment needs, an estimate of the amount
of laundry to be processed each hour must
be calculated by weight 
First, the weight of laundry to be done for each
inmate per week is calculatedThis is done by
identifying each article issued to an inmate, its
weight, and the frequency with which it will be
laundered in a weekItems issued to inmates
may include uniforms, underclothes, socks, bed
linens, towels, washcloths, coats, and shoesThe
weight of each item can be determined by simply
weighing a typical item on a scale 
The weekly laundry poundage for each inmate is
multiplied by the projected jail bed capacity, or
peak population estimate, to determine the facility’s
entire weekly laundry needsThe weekly
laundry poundage is then adjusted to account for
the fact that washers are not typically loaded to
capacityGenerally, they work best atpercent
of their rated capacity 
The adjusted weekly laundry poundage is then
divided by the number of hours per week the
laundry will operate to determine the amount of
laundry to be processed each hourAssume that
inmate workers can complete one load of laundry
per hourGenerally, the more hours the laundry
operates, the smaller the size of the equipment
neededThe formula for calculating washing
capacity is as follows:
Pounds laundry per inmate ×
launderings per week ×
peak population
= Pounds washing
Hours/week of operation × capacity needed
% efficiency
For example:
 pounds laundry per inmate ×
launderings per week ×
inmates
= pounds
washing
capacity
 hours/week operation ×
% efficiency
After the amount of laundry to be processed each
hour is determined, the equipment can be selected 
When choosing equipment, select at least
two sets of washers and dryers to permit laundering
different types of articles at the same time
and to provide at least one working washer or
dryer if one breaks downThe combined capacity
of the washers should exceed the hourly capacity
needs, and the dryers should have a capacity
slightly larger than the washers to account for
moisture in the laundry articles 
If the number of items laundered and/or the frequency
of laundering changes, a factor must be
applied to the formula to account for the change 
The future expansion of bed capacity should also
be considered in planningExpansion can be accommodated
by oversizing equipment, providing
space and plumbing for additional equipment,
or increasing the number of hours of operation

Corridor and doorway widths should be coordinated
to allow passage of repaired or replacement
equipment 
Work/Storage
Issue: Adequate area must be provided for
washers, dryers, work space, and supply
storage 
Response: In addition to washing and drying
equipment, space may be required for:
 Dry cleaning 
 Folding tables 
 Laundry carts (separate carts or
compartments for soiled and clean
laundry) 
 Laundry tubs (presoaking) 
 Supply storage 
 Ironing or pressing 
 Mending 
 Laundry scale 
 Temporary storage of clean linen and
clothing until it can be moved to appropriate
separate areas 
It may also be wise to consider providing automatic
chemical dispensing equipment if inmates
work in the laundryThis equipment helps eliminate
the problem of using inappropriate amounts
of detergent, fabric softeners, or bleachAlthough
this equipment costs more, it may be worth the
additional expense

Characteristics
Issue: The laundry area should have special design
characteristics appropriate to its needs 
Response: Some special design characteristics
to consider when designing a laundry
area include:
 An excellent ventilation system that
exhausts moisture and excessive heat
directly to the outside 
 Adequate floor drains 
 Trough to accommodate discharge of
water from washers 
 Janitor’s floor sink for mopping up
spills 
 Nonslip floor surfaces 
 Fire detection, suppression, and evacuation
systems 
 Moisture-resistant surfaces 
 Small desk 
 Water fountain 
 Inmate worker toilet and sink 
 Television or radio for the inmate
workers who may spend long hours in
the laundry area

Administration and Public Areas
The jail’s administration and public reception
areas are essential to the organization and
management of daily business within the
facilityThey are also essential to accommodate
the public’s need for access to the facility and
other aspects of the jail operationThe various
activities performed in these areas are:
 Establishing and ensuring the execution of operational
and security policies and procedures 
 Managing the business affairs of the jail, including
general accounting, ordering supplies
and goods, and managing inmate accounts
and bond moneys 
 Maintaining essential records, with the possible
exception of medical and classification
records 
 Receiving and distributing moneys, mail,
packages, and clothing for inmates 
 Conducting inventories of all facility supplies
and equipment 
 Managing personnel, including the organization
of training, daily briefings, and incidental
meetings 
 Dealing with the public in person and by mail
and telephone 
 Accommodating outside groups for tours and
presentations 
 Responding to requests for information and
reports from county commissioners and other
officials 
 Meeting with local media personnel 
 Storing miscellaneous supplies related to administrative
functions 
 Conferring with other criminal justice system
officials 
Older jails usually lack work spaces for administrative
staff, records functions, and for meeting
with the publicIn some jails, administrative office
areas were created out of corridor space or
niches in basement areasRecord storage was
sometimes accommodated by using a muchneeded
jail cellThe public frequently penetrated
the security perimeter to reach law enforcement
dispatch or jail office areas that were used for
public reception 
With the increased emphasis on professional jail
administration and the need to accommodate public
contact, administration and public areas are
receiving more attention when new jails are designed 
However, the adequacy of administrative/
public space can still be a problem that may not get
the attention it deserves during planning and design 
This deficiency may result from oversights by
the planning team or from an inclination to reduce
administration and staff areas when jail budgets are
limited 
Many diverse spaces are associated with the
administration/public component and typically
include:

F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
Key Decisions
As the role of the administration/public component
is evaluated, the following decisions should
be made because they have a fundamental impact
on design requirements:
 Will jail administration, support staff, and
public reception functions be merged with
those of law enforcement? What areas will
they share (e g , a common lobby)?
 How and by whom will public reception and
outside telephone calls be handled during normal
office hours and after office hours?
 How will mail, packages, clothing, and other
items be received and managed?
 Will the administration area be within the
main security perimeter of the jail? If so, will
the public enter the security perimeter to meet
with jail administrative staff?
 Will offices for program and service staff be located
in the administration area near program
areas in the jail?
Detail Issues
The following issues should be considered in
the development of the administration/public
component: location/arrangement, lobby/
reception, administrative support/work areas,
administrator’s office, conference areas, and
security equipment 
Location/Arrangement
Issue: The administration component should be
accessible to both the public and the inmateoccupied
areas of the jail without creating
security conflicts 
Response: Administrative staff interact with
the public, salespeople, the media, and
other official visitors on a daily basisTherefore,
access to the administration area must
be convenient and as direct as possible 
This essentially means that administrative
offices, meeting rooms, and the public lobby
must be adjacent to each other 
It is also important for the lobby area to be adjacent
to the inmate visiting area or the access
point to the visiting areaThis not only facilitates
the regular visiting process but is necessary in
facilities where standards require immediate
postarrest contact between inmates and family
members, friends, attorneys, and bondspersons 
This visiting access must be providedhours a
day, days a week 
Public access to administration areas should be
controlled in order to protect staff and to safeguard
confidential records in the areaSuch control
can be attained by:
 Creating a security door between the public
and administration areas 
 Providing protected reception counters or
areas 
 If an open reception counter is used, providing
a means by which it can be secured after office
hours and transferring reception responsibilities
to a secure space such as master control 
Separate Administration Area From
Jail Perimeter
Since the public should not have access to the jail
security perimeter, a good way to provide both proper
location and security is to locate the administration
area outside the main security perimeter but adjacent
to it (exhibit )The need for this separation
becomes more important if jail administrative functions
(e g , administrative support services, records)
are merged with law enforcement functions, since
law enforcement personnel should generally be
separated from inmate areas

Although separating administrative
areas from the security perimeter is a
good principle, it may pose a logistical
problem for the small jail administrator
whose frequent presence within
the jail is requiredIn smaller jails the administrator
may be integrally involved in providing
staff supervision or even security and services to
inmates because of staff limitations 
Placement of the small jail administrator’s office
outside the security perimeter could cause considerable
inconvenience to the jail administrator
who must perform line-officer dutiesThe following
concepts should be considered to address this
problem:
 The jail administrator’s office might be located
just inside the inmate-occupied part of the perimeter
and adjacent to the facility’s administrative
support areas located outside the perimeter 
A secure passthrough between the two areas
would allow the jail administrator and administrative
support staff to transfer documents
without continuously having to penetrate the
security vestibule of the perimeter 
 The jail administrator’s office might be situated
just outside the primary jail security perimeter
and a secondary desk or work area,
with file storage, could be located within the
perimeter 
The approach taken to this problem depends on
the frequency of public contact with the jail administrator,
the jail administrator’s need for direct
contact with administrative support staff
and access to records, and the degree to which
the jail administrator performs fundamental
security tasks 
Issue: The administration area should be linked
with other functional components with which it
frequently interacts 
Response:
 It is desirable to locate the staff areas
and the administration areas adjacent
to each other for the following reasons:
Convenience for attending staff briefings 
Enhanced management of staff activities 
A common need to be in an area secured
from the public, yet outside the main
security perimeter of the jail 
Sharing of spaces such as multipurpose,
training, and conference rooms 
 All jails, regardless of size, can use a
meeting or conference space in the
administration area to hold meetings
with the publicAdministration
areas, particularly the records area,
should be as accessible as possible
to master control/dispatch and the
intake-release areas for the convenient
transfer of recordsThis is especially
true in cases where computerized data
systems are limited or not in use and
hardcopy records must be transferred 
Unless so located, jail staff will be
forced to deliver files to intake-release
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
at inopportune times or maintain active
records in that area instead of in a
central records location 
 Administrative staff should be able to
enter their area quickly and directly
from their parking areasAccess can
be gained through the public lobby
or, preferably, through a separate staff
entrance 
 Direct access from the outside into
individual administrative offices, such
as the administrator’s office, is discouraged
because this poses additional
security and surveillance problemsIt
should be recognized that acts of violence
may be directed toward administrative
staffAs a rule, the number of
openings into any perimeter should be
minimized 
 Administrative and public areas
should be located so they can be expanded
as facility operations grow, or
the facility should be planned with
surplus offices and space in which to
grow 
Lobby/Reception
Issue: A lobby and reception area should be
provided to properly and effectively accommodate
contact with the public 
Response: The public lobby is the primary
point of contact for all public and official
visitors to the jailA visitor’s impression of
the lobby and reception areas will greatly
influence the jail’s image in the community
and the reaction of visitors to jail staff 
The following characteristics should be considered
in developing the lobby and reception areas:
 The lobby area should be sized to provide at
leastsquare feet for each person expected
to use the area at one timeA more generous
allocation of space is encouraged to enhance
public use and impressions of the areaTo
determine the number of individuals who will
use the lobby area, it is important to decide
whether the lobby will be used only for inmate
visitors or whether it must also accommodate
visitors waiting for general business purposes,
attorneys waiting for visits with inmates, law
enforcement, or other criminal justice functions
associated with the jailAllowances
might also be made for large groups that come
to the jail for tours or presentations about jail
activities, such as county commissioners, citizen
committees, and grand juries 
 Acoustic treatment should be provided to improve
the quality of the space, especially when
large groups with children are in the area 
 Sound separation between the lobby and adjacent
jail administration and jail security areas
is important

C h a p t e r :
A d m i n i s t r a t i o n a n d P u b l i c A r e a s
 The lobby space should be pleasant and comfortable,
with natural light if possible 
 The reception area should be readily accessible
and visible to the visitorIt is advantageous for
the visitor to be able to establish eye contact
with the reception staff immediately upon entering
the jail 
 The lobby area sets the tone for the public’s
experience at the facilityThe lobby should
always be comfortable, clean, and well organized,
and reception staff should be cordial
and helpful 
 View conflicts between the lobby area and the
jail perimeter should be avoided while still
allowing direct eye contact between the reception
staff and the visitor 
 Around-the-clock reception
Issue: A method of accommodating contact with
the publichours a day, days a week must be
established 
Response: The public will need to have
contact with the jailhours a day, days
a weekSuch contact might be made by
inmates’ family members, bondspersons,
attorneys, and others who need communication
outside of a standard a mto p m ,
Monday to Friday scheduleConsequently, it
is important to determine who will perform
reception duties for the facility at all hours
of the day and during the weekendsThe
basic options include:
 A full-time receptionist (support staff
or officer) performs all reception
functions 
 Master control performs all reception
functions (this can only be accomplished
in smaller facilities where
the master control officer has fewer
tasks) 
 A law enforcement dispatcher performs
all reception functions 
 A receptionist or member of administrative
support staff performs weekday
reception functions, and master control
and/or dispatch performs nighttime
and weekend reception functions 
Visitation presents the potential for high emotions
and security problemsDuring visitation,
any nonsecurity personnel at the reception post
should have access to immediate assistance from
a deputy or security officer 
Secure and controlled nighttime and weekend reception
can be achieved by creating a night lobby
or vestibule to which the public can gain access
without penetrating the main lobby (exhibit -
 )Preferably, such a night lobby will be adjacent
to a staff post such as master control, the
dispatch area, or the records area so that public
needs can be dealt with directly and securelyIn
the event a night lobby area cannot be directly
viewed by master control, it will be necessary to
install a closed-circuit television (CCTV) and audio
communications link to the areaRegardless
of location, some form of passthrough opening
should enable those coming to the jail to transfer
material to master control or to the dispatcher
without having the officer leave the secure post 
If the night reception post cannot be located
adjacent to the night lobby, the design should establish
visibility between the reception area and
the public in the night lobby, if possibleIf this is

not possible, 
Receiving packages
Issue: The means by which packages, clothing,
money, and other items are received from the
public should be secure and convenient 
Response: The public will bring a variety of
items to the facility for inmates’ useThey
may bring clothing that will be worn for
court appearances, cash, or personal items,
as permitted by jail rulesThese materials
can be received securely received in the following
ways:
 There may be a secure package or
paper passthrough in the wall of a
secure reception areaIf the reception
point is master control, the package
passthrough raises a security concern
about explosives, chemical and biological
agents, or other items that would

 Facility staff could leave the security
perimeter to receive and screen the
contents of the items before allowing
them within the security perimeter 
This method is inconvenient for staff
and takes them away from other security
duties 
 Administrative support staff or dedicated
reception staff could accept
materials only during the dayThe
security staff would then leave the perimeter
at a convenient time to receive
and check the materials prior to final
acceptance 
A combination of these approaches might best
satisfy reception needsSome jails have used
x-ray screening equipment for all packages and
mail entering the facility 
Lobby support elements
Issue: Proper support space and equipment
should be provided for the lobby area

Response: Several space and equipment
considerations should be made during the
design of the lobby area, including the
following:
 “Visiting Areas”) 

Administrative Support Work Areas
These are the work areas for administrative support
and records staff and other miscellaneous
functions associated with facility administration 
Issue: The basic activities of the administrative
support staff should be determined to establish
size and equipment requirements 
Response: The support staff area forms the
core of the administration areaFundamental
functions are performed in this area,
with some variations 
A primary variation concerns whether support
staff will be involved in contacts with the public 
If so, their space needs to be immediately adjacent
to, and accessible from, the public lobby
areaThe method by which the public will be
received should also be determined since it can
be done either in a secure manner (e g , visitors
speaking through a secure telephone, intercom,
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
or passthrough) or by having visitors approach or
enter the administrative support area and speak
directly with administrative support staff across a
counter or desk 

Administrative support staff typically perform the
following activities:
 Typing or entering data 
 Maintaining files 
 Establishing and keeping records 
 Copying and collating reports and information 
 Logging and sorting mail 
 Maintaining accounts and purchasing 
 Controlling and managing inventory of facility
office supplies 
 Transcribing dictated information 
Common types of equipment associated with
typical administrative support activities include:
 
Issue: A variety of functions associated with the
support work area may require separate space 
Response: Such areas are either provided
within the administrative support area, an
adjacent alcove, or an adjacent separate
space 
 Supply storageStorage space should
be provided for pens, pencils, paper,
copier supplies, printer cartridges, file
folders, forms, and so forthThe size
of this space depends on the range of
items stored and the inventory maintained
(a large file cabinet may be
adequate in very small jails)If wholesale
purchases of items such as customized
forms and copier paper will
be made from office supply distributers
(because of cost considerations),
a fairly significant amount of space
might be needed to store office supplies 
In larger jails these supplies are
often stored in a main warehouse area

Security Equipment
Issue: Provisions must be made for storage of
emergency response equipment 
Response: The facility will probably need to
maintain a variety of security equipment,
including:
 
This equipment should be stored in a controllable
area outside the jail’s main security perimeter 
There is no single best location, but common
locations include:
 Secure armory in the vehicle sallyport 
 Sheriff’s law enforcement weapons armory (if
a joint facility) 
 Secure armory in the jail’s administration area
(if outside the security perimeter) 
Regardless of location, several characteristics of
the security equipment storage space must be
considered, including:
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Secure and lockable door 
 Security construction for the wall, floor, and
ceiling 
 Access limited to the jail administrator or law
enforcement supervisors and other key jail personnel
selected by the jail administrator (e g ,
the special emergency response team) 
 Proximity briefing areas where officers might
assemble in emergencies and be issued security
equipment 
 Detectors and alarms if chemical agents or
ammunition are stored in the space 
 Special ventilation if chemical agents are
stored in the space 
 Proper and accessible shelving and storage
compartments for the equipment to be stored
in the space

Staff Areas
No one spends more time in jail than the
jail staffYet jails across the country have
consistently neglected to address the
needs of jail staff 
Motivation and management experts state there
is growing evidence that corporations that fail to
address staff needs send a clear message to their
employees: “You don’t count around here!” By
making an architectural statement that clearly
recognizes and accommodates the needs of its
jail staff, a local government can make a lasting
contribution to positive employer-employee relations,
staff morale, and productivity 
In this , “staff areas” are defined as those
spaces that are specifically intended for the
private use of jail staffThese include a lounge
or break room, training areas, exercise rooms,
locker/shower rooms, and toiletsThey do not
include staff control posts, which are dealt with
in, “Master Control,” and,
“General Housing ”
Newly built jails around the country have some
or all of the staff areas identifiedSome smaller
jails have cleverly consolidated some of the
spaces under the heading of a staff “multipurpose”
or “multiuse” roomIt is not necessary to
view every staff space as having a mutually exclusive
purposeThe trick is to avoid taxing any
one area with too much staff or traffic or with
activities that are inappropriately combined, as in
one small jail where the coffee room and weight
room occupied the same space 
A key space-sharing concept in smaller
jails is that of creating common
staff areas for both law enforcement
and jail personnelWith few exceptions,
there is no substantial reason
to separate many of these areasIt is important,
however, to consider providing equal accommodations
for each to help avoid the age-old problem
of perceiving law enforcement work as more
important and desirable than jail work 
Key Decisions
The following decisions have a fundamental effect
on design requirements and should be made
when evaluating the role of staff areas:
 Will jail officers routinely change into uniforms
at the facility? Will locker and shower
areas be needed? Where will officers store
coats, boots, hats, and articles that should not
enter the security envelope (e g , weapons,
holsters, cell phones, pocket knives, and, perhaps,
matches and lighters)?
 Will there be physical fitness requirements and
defensive tactics training for officers that can
be met or encouraged by providing proper facilities
at the jail?
 Will staff receive regular or daily briefings on
the previous shift’s activities and their responsibilities,
or for other purposes?
 Will staff be allowed breaks away from their
posts? Will they eat meals away from their
posts? Does the administration want to encourage
camaraderie by providing a place for staff
to meet before or after work?
 Where will staff receive formal training? Will
training be done at the jail or at a separate
training facility?
 If the law enforcement function is in the same
facility, which staff areas can be shared?

Detail Issues
The following detailed functional-architectural
issues relate to the various functions and spaces
that make up the private staff areas of the facility:
general issues, locker/shower areas, physical
conditioning area, break room, training/
multipurpose area, toilets 
General Issues
Issue: Staff areas should be located outside the
secure envelope of the jail 
Response: It is not in the best interests of
jail security and operations to place staff
areas within the security envelope because
off-duty jail officers, and especially law
enforcement officers, within the envelope
can distract the attention of on-duty staff
and inmatesStaff areas should be near and
easily accessible to an access point in the
secure perimeter to avoid unnecessary delay
in moving into the jail 
The exceptions to this rule are staff dining or
staff break areas served by the jail kitchen (but
off limits to off-duty staff)These areas would
need to be inside the security perimeter 
Staff areas are not public areasTherefore, they
need to be separate and secured from unwanted
public traffic 
Issue: Staff parking and entry must be considered
in the design 
Response: Providing adequate parking for
staff is importantDoing so generally entails
the following considerations:
 Sufficient parking to accommodate
shift overlap needs so that personal
and departmental vehicles are not left
on the street or in places other than
the staff parking area 
 Protected parking, or at least parking
separate from the public and visitor
parking areas 
Protected or separate parking recognizes the professional
status of staff and guards against vandalism 
It can be provided in several ways:
 Underground garages or above-grade structures,
with or without a controlled access
point, that provide protection from the weather 
 A fenced-in parking area behind a control gate 
 A separate area, less visible to the public,
possibly with access controlled by a gate 
Staff should enter the jail through a staff-only
entranceWhen determining the location of the
staff entrance, the following should be taken into
consideration:
 The entry point is convenient to staff parking 
 Entry to the staff areas is secured and entry
requires a proximity card issued to staff, a remote
unlock from a dispatch center or master
control, or a coded electric lock with keypad 
 There is a conveniently located place, such as
a locker area, for staff to deposit weapons and
personal belongings before entering the jail security
envelope 
 If staff briefing/rollcall or training rooms are
to be included in the design, they should be
located near the staff locker rooms outside the
secure perimeter 
Locker/Shower Areas
All facilities need to provide locker and shower
space for staffThe size of the space and the
amenities offered depend on the particulars of
a given operationFactors that contribute to the
use of and need for this space include:
 
C h a p t e r :
S t a f f A r e a s
 Absence of any other space to secure personal
property or clothing during the work shift 
 Provision of physical conditioning space and
equipment within the facility 
 Policies that forbid uniformed staff from wearing
their uniform to and from work 
 Need to change into civilian clothes for court 
 Potential for contact with soiled clothing or
laundry or bodily fluids 
 Need for storage of extra uniforms or issued
equipment 
 Requirements for staff to work overtime shifts 
Activities/characteristics
Issue: Space, equipment, hardware, and finishes
should be appropriate for the activities and
needs of the area 
Response: Locker/shower area activities
are little different from those in conventional
public facilities, such as a gymThey
include:
 Dressing and undressing 
 Clothing exchange/storage of coats,
hats, boots 
 Storage of spare uniforms 
 Storage of holsters, belts, and miscellaneous
job-related paraphernalia, if
not weapons 
 Storage of policy and procedure manuals
(if not automated) and other
documents 
 Grooming (counter, sink, and mirror
are necessary) 
 Showering and drying 
 Hand and face washing 
 Toilet 
 Temporary storage of clean and dirty
towels 
When designing a locker/shower area, equipment,
hardware, and finish considerations
include:
 

Female staff
Issue: Separate areas for female staff should be
included in the design 
Response: Female officers are employed at
jails in greater numbers than ever before 
While female staff can clearly share break
rooms, physical fitness, and training areas
with male staff, they should be afforded the
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
privacy of separate showers and locker areas 
This area was often overlooked in older
and smaller facilities and should be accommodated
in new facilities 
Locker/shower area size
Issue: The size of the locker/shower areas depends
on the number and flow of users and their
basic equipment needs 
Response: (, “Staffing Impact,”
in section reviews the difference between
staff totals and staff shift counts )

of articles that might be stored, including:

 
C h a p t e r :
S t a f f A r e a s
Physical Conditioning Area

Space size
Issue: The size of the area depends on the number
of people using it and types of activities 
Response: The size of a physical conditioning
area is influenced by the following
factors:
 Total number of potential exercisers at
any one time 
E x h i b i t Lockers Elevated on a Base
Built-in
bench
 Whether the area will be jointly used
by both jail and law enforcement staff
or other county employees 
 Type of activities accommodated in
the area:

 , “Exercise Areas,” provides further
information on some of the space needs of these
activities 
Access
Issue: A dedicated staff exercise area should be
located outside of the security envelope 
Response: 
Break Room/Dining Area

(Staff dining is also discussed in,
“Food Service ”)
Break room size
Issue: The size of the staff break room/dining
area depends on the activities, users, and equipment
involved 
Response: Activities that typically occur in a
break room include the following:
 Storage of personal meals and
foodstuffs 
 Soft drink and snack vending 
 Refrigeration of perishable meals and
snacks brought from home 
 Eating of meals 
 Recreational reading 
 Conversation 
 “Time-outs” or stress-reducing breaks 
 Preparation of hot and cold beverages 
 Limited meal preparation (warming,
toasting) 
Equipment and furnishings for which space may
be needed include:
 Tables and chairs 
 Sink (gooseneck faucet for easy filling) 
 Countertops 
 Drawers for utensils 
 Storage for cleaning supplies, cups, dishes 
 Kitchen appliances (coffeemaker, toaster,
microwave) 
 Hot plate or countertop stove elements 
 Under-cabinet lighting 
 Electrical outlets near counter 
 Refrigerated storage for food and drink 
 Trophy cabinets, shelves 
 Bulletin boards 
 Telephone 
 Intercom (if walkie-talkies are not used) 
 Television (TV) 
 Vending machines 
 
C h a p t e r :
S t a f f A r e a s
The break room should accommodate about 
percent of the staff on the largest shift, including
jail officers, administrators, and support staffIf
the break room is shared with law enforcement
staff, their needs must also be met 
If smoking is prohibited in the facility, an outdoor
courtyard with a covered area adjacent to
the break room would be appropriate and would
help keep the officer who smokes in close proximity
to where he/she may be needed if an emergency
arisesThe natural light introduced to the
break room through an adjacent courtyard is also
beneficial

provided for staff, such as the salad bar, television, outdoor area, art,
and plants 
(Photograph courtesy of Jim Rowenhorst )
Break room location
Issue: The break room might be located within
the security envelope of the jail 
Response: The break room/dining area
might best be placed within the security envelope
of the jail and near the kitchen and
thus separate from the other staff areas if:
 Staff meals are provided by the jail
kitchen (already within the jail
perimeter) 
 The break room is not intended for
use by law enforcement personnel 
 The space is essentially limited to the
break room function and does not
serve as a conference room, training
area, or staff multipurpose room 
 The sheriff or jail administrator
wants to keep staff who are taking a
scheduled break within the security
envelope so that they can respond
quickly to an emergency or problem
that might arise(This may especially
be the case in the small jail because
the total number of staff available per
shift may be quite limited )
Training/Multipurpose Area
Training is a must for jails of any sizeAlthough
larger jails may have extensive training facilities,
both inside and outside of the facility, a
totally separate training area may be impractical
for the smaller jail unless the combined training
demands of jail and law enforcement are
high enough to justify oneHowever, this will
vary with organizational philosophy and training
requirementsOne common approach in jails
where consolidation is feasible is a combination
training/conference/briefing room 
The following functional issues apply to the design
of an area for staff training, briefing, and
conference rooms 
Issue: The training area in a jail can often function
as a dualor multipurpose staff space 
Response: Design and plan to furnish the
space in such a way that its location and
furnishings accommodate a wide range of
activitiesCarefully evaluate the activities
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
that will take place in addition to training 
Without good planning, jails, especially
smaller jails, often fail to detail the nature
and type of staff areas needed and end up
with one or more poorly defined and designed
rooms 
Staff areas should never be merged with inmate
multipurpose spaceAside from time and security
conflicts (e g , inmate access to staff equipment,
information, training documents), there may be
sufficient legitimate, staff-related activities, even
in smaller jails, to justify provision of a separate
staff multipurpose areaSuch a space could accommodate
the following compatible staff activities
and functions:
 Conferences and meetings 
 Shift briefings/rollcall 
 Staff training 
 Staff defensive tactics training 
 Staff library and training resource storage 
 Audiovisual storage (LCD projector, laptop
computer, video camera, VCR/DVD player,
TV, movie screen, easel, and related training
supplies) 
 Provision for training programs through cable
TV or Internet broadcasts 
 Often computer workstations are made available
to staff in this or another area that allow
staff to access logs, policies and procedures,
e-mail, or other work-related information 
Staff training room 
(Photograph courtesy of Jim Rowenhorst )
Issue: Equipment, hardware, and furnishings
should match activities and functions 
Response: The following considerations
apply for the staff multipurpose area:
 Size and shape should be compatible
with classroom-style instruction 
 Lighting should be adjustable and
suitable for both audiovisual presentations
and reading 
 Folding tables and folding or stackable
chairs enhance flexibility 
 If the room is of sufficient size, a
moveable, ceiling-suspended divider
adds flexibility for schedulingAn access
door should be provided for each
side 
 Windows are desirable but are not
as great a priority as wall space for
shelves, marker boards, tackboards,
and storage cabinets 
 Finishes and furnishings should be
suitable for activities that entail instruction,
reading, writing, listening,
concentration, group discussion, and
even physical trainingAn attempt
should be made to design, finish,
and furnish the space in a way that
distinguishes it from the starker
 
C h a p t e r :
S t a f f A r e a s
surroundings in other areas of the
jailOtherwise, part of the benefit of
having a separate staff multipurpose
space will be lost 
 Lockable storage should be available
for such equipment as projectors, tape
recorders, video cameras, digital video
disk players, TVs, and training documents
that might include sensitive
policies and proceduresIf defensive
tactics training is included, storage
for mats and related equipment is appropriate,
as is storage for chairs and
tables so that the area may be cleared 
Issue: The staff training room might be merged
into a space used for other staff functions 
Response: Since the training room might
be used for short periods during the day
for regularly scheduled briefings or rollcall,
and training might occur irregularly and at
different times, it may be wise to consider
merging the functions into one multipurpose
spaceCompatible staff functions
include:
 Training 
 Briefing/rollcall 
 Library 
 Staff mailboxes 
 Staff conferences 
Merging physical conditioning with the training/
conference functions is not recommendedThe
physical conditioning area will have fixed equipment
that is not easy to move out of the way
when the room is used for other activitiesThe
key to any merging of functions is to identify the
nature, timing, and frequency involved and to
ensure there are no incompatibilities or conflicts 
In very small facilities, merging the
break area and training area may be a
good use of spaceTo give some spatial
definition to the break area in a
multipurpose setting, two ideas might
be considered, among others:
 Creating an alcove area for the break room off
the main multipurpose space 
 Providing partitions to separate the food preparation
and storage area from the training/
multipurpose area (exhibit ) 
The break area can be made to complement the
multipurpose concept by:
 Using stackable chairs for staff dining/breaks 
 Using folding tables that can be moved out of
the way 
 Providing an adjacent storage space

Toilets
Issue: There is a need for staff toilet facilities
within the security envelope 
Response: There are many options for
providing proper toilet facilities for staff
consistent with security and operational
goalsEven in the smaller jail, there will undoubtedly
be both male and female public
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
toilet facilities in the public reception area
and staff toilets in locker/shower areasIf
it is intended that these toilets be used by
on-duty staff, consideration must be given
to the fact that this practice may require
staff to move outside the security envelope,
creating security problems and considerable
inconvenienceIn new jails, staff toilet
facilities should be planned in various locations
inside the security envelope of the jail
as a convenience to staff and to facilitate
security in the facility 
Staff could use the inmate facilities located in the
intake/booking area, although they might object
for hygienic reasonsIf the jail operates a secure
master control or housing control, it will be necessary
to locate a single unisex restroom within
the control spaceHowever, the use of this restroom
by roving staff might violate the perimeter
of the control center more than desired by security
policyIn direct supervision facilities, there is
usually a staff toilet in the housing area that can
be used by the officer assigned to the unit and
roving officers 
It may be best to provide separate unisex toilet
facilities in other areas within the security envelope
accessible to staff, such as the intake-release
area or staff break roomThese facilities should
be in easily accessible locations and generally out
of view of the inmates 
Space List
Some typical spaces that might be within the
staff component include the following:
 Locker/shower area:
Male 
Female 
 Physical conditioning, including storage 
 Defensive tactics training 
 Break room (possibly including outdoor
courtyard) 
 Training/multipurpose area, including storage 
 Staff toilets within secure perimeter

Storage Areas
Storage space must be provided in virtually
every functional component of a jailAlthough
less prominent, it is as vital as any
other space to attaining efficient and convenient
operationsThe presence of files, mattresses, and
paper goods in the corridors, fire stairs, interview
rooms, and staff offices of existing jails is
testimony to the fact that storage space has been
consistently underestimated in planning and designing
new jails 
The storage needs of the various jail functionalarchitectural
components are documented
throughout section; thisaddresses
miscellaneous storage needsAdditionally, since
storage is often an overlooked or underestimated
aspect of jail design, thissummarizes
typical storage needs for all components in a
jail of any size and thereby focuses attention
on them 
Key Decisions
The following decisions have a fundamental effect
on design requirements and should be made
when the role of storage is evaluated:
 Is there an opportunity for shared storage
space between the jail and sheriff’s law enforcement
operation?
 What items can be stored together in a general
purpose storage room or warehouse, and what
items will require separate space?
 Should certain items be stored in one central
area, or should they be stored in satellite storage
areas served by a central source for greater
daily convenience (e g , linens, toiletries, and/
or mattresses distributed from a small storage
space at the housing unit but supplied from a
larger, centralized storage area)?
 Will the jail emphasize purchasing at wholesale
and, therefore, in large quantities (e g ,
food, toiletries, inmate clothing)?

Detail Issues
The following detailed functional-architectural issues
should be considered in the development of
storage spaces: miscellaneous storage needs and
overall facility storage concerns 
Miscellaneous Storage Needs
Issue: There are numerous miscellaneous storage
needs aside from those associated with
specific functional-architectural components 
Response: Miscellaneous storage needs not
yet addressed in other s in this section
include the following:
 Central storage/warehouseThis
serves as the primary storage area
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
for a variety of important items, most
of which should be identified before
design and others after the facility is
opened, for example:
Bulk supplies (e g , toilet paper, soaps,
detergents, office supplies, forms) 
Extra mattresses, pillows, linens, inmate
clothing 
Separate, lockable storage area for items
sold in the commissary 
Items used in routine maintenance (e g ,
air filters, fan belts, oil, car parts, grease
guns) 
 Replacement partsEvery facility should store
replacement parts for vital elements of facility
operations and securityFor example, it would
be wise to provide storage for replacement
items such as locks, hinges, security glass
panels, toilet fixtures, food passage doors,
door closers, and door handles as a precaution
against damage that compromises the effective
operation of the facilityStorage of such parts
would avoid delays in obtaining replacement
items, especially special detention itemsIn
larger facilities, a maintenance work area is
often designed into the facilityIn this case,
replacement parts, tools, and items used in
routine maintenance would be stored in the
maintenance area 
 Outdoor equipmentEvery facility needs storage
space for outdoor equipment unless the
county has another department that manages
outdoor maintenance for the jailEquipment
that might be stored includes lawn mowers,
garden hoses, ladders, yard tractors, snow
blowers, shovels, rakes, hoes, and so forth 
This need increases if the facility has an inmate
gardening programOutdoor equipment
should not be stored in a vehicle sallyport,
which has been a common practice in the
pastRather, it should be in a secured space in
another location accessible directly from the
outside, if possible 
 Cleaning supplies and equipmentEvery facility
needs to maintain cleanlinessThis principally
involves keeping the floors, furnishings,

S t o r a g e A r e a s
and windows clean by the use of mops, buckets,
cleaning fluids, cloths, floor buffers, and
so forthStorage space for these items should
be provided liberally throughout the facility,
preferably in each housing unitCleaning
equipment is normally stored in a janitor’s
closet that also includes a janitor’s sink or
wash tub and a capacity for storing such items
as cleaning fluids and dust clothsCare should
be taken to keep toxic, flammable, and caustic
materials secured from unauthorized inmate
access 
Overall Facility Storage Concerns
This section summarizes basic storage needs in
general and some of the characteristics of storage
facilities 
Summary list
Issue: All storage needs for the entire facility
should be identified and associated with their
proper functional-architectural component 
Response: Typical storage needs in a jail
encompass master control, intake-release,
general and special housing, health care,
visiting, indoor and outdoor exercise,
inmate programs and services, commissary,
food service, laundry, administrative/
public areas, staff areas, and miscellaneous

Security
Issue: All storage facilities must be properly
secured 
Response: In general, it is appropriate to
prevent random access to all storage areas
in the facility by securing them with locked
doorsHowever, it is not necessary to provide
heavy security hardware, doors, and
construction for many of the facility’s storage
needs, unless they are located in areas
with unsupervised inmate access 
High security is needed principally when the
storage facility contains something valuable or
potentially dangerous or provides a route of escape
to inmates who have access to the storage
areaHowever, the ability to observe the storage
area or the access to it may lessen the need for
security constructionFor example, if a storage
area for cleaning fluids and chemicals is directly
across from a constantly staffed post, a hollow
metal door with an institutional lockset or a lowsecurity
detention lockset might be adequate 
The gauge of the metal in the door might be
selected more on the basis of durability than
security 
In assessing security needs with respect to storage,
the following types of storage require the
highest level of security:
 Officer weaponry 
 Jail keys/proximity cards 
 Medications 
 Cutlery and utensils 
 Personal property, especially money and
valuables 
 Medical instruments and equipment 
 Cleaning fluids and detergents 
 Restraint and riot equipment 
 
 :
F u n c t i o n a l C o m p o n e n t s
 Commissary and bond monies 
 Other chemicals and toxic materials 
Special attention should also be paid to the security
provided for the following types of storage:
 First-aid kits 
 Toiletries 
 Radios and other communication devices 
 Fire extinguishers 
 Self-contained breathing apparatus 
 Medical records 
 Other records 
 Personal clothing/bulk property 
 Personal articles belonging to visitors 
 Foodstuffs 
Proper security for the preceding storage
items can be provided through a combination
of approaches:
 Placing certain stored items within enclosed
security staff posts 
 Keeping items outside areas accessible to
inmates 
 Directly observing access to the storage
area(s) 
 Employing secure construction around the
space, including walls, floors, ceilings, doors,
and locks 
 Forbidding inmate access and limiting staff
access to sensitive storage areas, such as
money, property, weapons, and key storage 
Size
Issue: The size of storage space depends on
many factors, including institutional policies and
procedures 
Response: The amount of space to provide
in any given storage situation depends
greatly on the policies and procedures of the
facility and the activities that it plans to undertake 
Consequently, proper storage space
planning must identify these policies, procedures,
and activitiesSome factors involved
in establishing storage space requirements
include:
 The range of things that must be
stored 
 Size of inventory, which is influenced
by ordering and replacement practices 
 Surplus or overflow stocks 
 Storage methods, particularly those
that use the full height of storage
spaces 
 Capability of storing a wide variety of
items in a common area or space 
 System of distribution, which generally
varies between a central storage and
distribution capability and a smaller
central storage area complemented by
satellite storage spaces elsewhere in
the building 
 Work activities related to storage (e g ,
inventory control, ordering, sorting) 
Location
Issue: Storage areas need to be conveniently
located 
Response: To be used efficiently, storage
spaces must be properly locatedHowever,
because many storage functions are not
necessarily critical to the minute-by-minute
operation of the jail, some selectivity in locating
storage facilities is importantThis is
particularly true when the methods of surveillance
in the facility and the movement
 
C h a p t e r :
S t o r a g e A r e a s
of inmates from housing to other areas dictate
that higher priority be given to locating
other functional componentsSome criteria
to consider when locating storage space
include:
 Security of the space and the need to
isolate it from access 
 Frequency of use 
 Affiliation of the location and the
users involved 
The different priorities in locating storage space
are illustrated by contrasting jail clothing storage
for the booking area (where routine, -hour
daily access is required for the efficient flow of
inmate arrestees) and central supply storage
(which is commonly used only on day shift
and typically only by staff as part of a resupply
effort) 
Mechanical/plumbing concerns
Issue: Special mechanical requirements must
be recognized in developing storage space 
Response: Given the nature of some of the
items stored in a jail, special mechanical accommodations
must be made for the space
to function effectively and securelyThese
include the following:
 Ventilation for storage spaces containing
gases (security restraint storage
area) or cleaning fluids 
 Humidity controls for storage of paper
products, powdered detergents, and
similar items 
 Temperature control for areas such as
food service 
 Ventilation for storage that generates
odors, such as street clothes 
 Chemicals and other toxics

Some of the miscellaneous storage spaces that
have not been identified as part of the storage requirements
for the other functional-architectural
components include:
❏ Central storage/warehouse 
❏ Mattress storage/cleaning 
❏ Replacement parts

 Construction and Project Costs 
 Making a Building Work
Special Considerations
Four issues deserve special consideration in the development of a jail project 
 Single versus multiple occupancy 
 Renovating nonsecure buildings into jails 
 Construction and project costs 
 Making a building work 
These design and construction issues seem to regularly cause difficulty or controversy
in jurisdictions throughout the country, and how they are resolved can substantially
affect the outcome or direction of a projectAlthough space does not permit
a full exploration of each issue, these issues are addressed in the hopes that they
can be confronted and resolved more expeditiously and knowledgeably by both the
planner
and the jurisdiction

Single Versus Multiple Occupancy
An issue that frequently sparks debate
within a community is whether to design
inmate cells (sleeping rooms) with one
bed (single occupancy) or with two or more beds
(multiple occupancy)Local decisions in this regard
have a considerable impact on the design of
a jail, on project costs, and on the security and
management of the jail

Definitions
Multiple Occupancy
Multiple-occupancy sleeping rooms generally
come in three types: cell, “open bay,” and dormitory
styleThe cell style multiple-occupancy
room has historically included beds, a toilet, a
sink, and perhaps a desk, stool, and shelfIt does
not include such things as a shower or dining
table, which are normally provided in adjacent
or nearby dayroom spacesCell style multiple-occupancy
spaces typically hold two to eight
inmates 
Open-bay housing areas are essentially alcoves
off a central dayroom and contain,, or 
bunk-style bedsThe sleeping alcoves contain
nothing but bunks, and perhaps storage bins 
This type of housing has centralized toilet, sink,
and shower areas adjacent to the dayroom 
The dormitory style multiple-occupancy inmate
housing unit tends to be more self-contained 
Everything
needed to serve inmate personal
needs is within the single space: beds, toilet,
sink, shower, dining tables, storage, telephones,
televisions, and so forth (exhibit )In older
dormitory facilities, separate dayroom spaces
were not typically included; however, dayrooms
are often included in new jails that include

Standards and Legal Issues
Cases of constitutionality decided in the federal
court system have not fully resolved the question
of occupancyPrior to the late s, numerous
district courts condemned double celling (two
beds per cell)These rulings led to the creation
of single-occupancy cells in the affected jurisdictions
and led many to conclude that singleoccupancy
rooms were constitutional and
multiple-occupancy rooms were notHowever,
based on a close reading of the cases, one could
not conclude that double celling was in and of
itself unconstitutionalRather, double celling in
limited cases has been found unconstitutional
given the particular overall conditions of the
facilities in question: lack of adequate square
footage, unsanitary conditions, poor ventilation,
inadequate lighting (natural and artificial), lack
of privacy, isolation in the cell for extended
periods,
inadequate exercise opportunities outside
the cell, poor surveillance, and many other
deficiencies in and out of the cellblock area 
Later, the U SSupreme Court ruled on two
cases that dealt with the question of multiple
occupancy: Bell vWolfish () and Rhodes
vChapman ()In both cases, new facilities
were the topic of the suit, and in both cases,
the facilities were ruled fundamentally constitutional,
having healthful and standards-compliant
environments and a variety of amenities in and
out of the cellblock
areasThe Supreme Court
essentially found no constitutional violations on
grounds of occupancy alone in those two particular
situationsConsequently, thoughts that
multiple-occupancy housing was in and of itself
unconstitutional began
to change 
Since Bell vWolfish and Rhodes vChapman, it
has become clear that double celling in and of
itself is not a constitutional issue unless it can be
shown to be the cause of other problems, such as
violence related to “failure to protect ”
 
C h a p t e r :
S i n g l e V e r s u s M u l t i p l e O c c u p a n c y
In , the American Correctional Association
(ACA) published its Manual of Standards for
Adult Local Detention Facilities,which called
for the exclusive use of single-occupancy cells 
This position was also taken by the U SDepartment
of Justice and had been the policy of the
federal government in setting criteria for local
jail construction
projects funded by federal grant
moneysACA continued to call for single occupancy
in the second edition of the Standards 
In the third and fourth editions, ACA adopted
a more flexible standard that does not specify
numbers or percentages of single cells and allows
multiple-occupancy cells or dormitories, assuming
a series of standards related to square footage
are metACA emphasized that each inmate have
a minimum amount of “unencumbered” floor
space in the cell or dormitoryUnencumbered
floor space is floor area without an item of furniture
or equipment on or above it (exhibit )

Many states have also placed heavy emphasis
on a portion of the jail being single-occupancy
cellsThe most consistent exception to single
occupancy has been to allow multiple-occupancy
dormitories for work release/
periodic-sentence inmates or in-house inmate
workers (trusties) 
The Issue
Central to the single-occupancy/multiple-occupancy
issue is the cost of construction versus
management and operational concernsRapidly
increasing jail populations, the high costs of jail
construction, and tight local budgets have led
many county board and city council leaders to
argue for multiple occupancy, while greater security
and better management have led many sheriffs,
police chiefs, and jail administrators to argue
for single occupancy 
Costs
The following benefits of multiple occupancy
versus
single occupancy do indeed lead to
reduced
construction costs:
 Fewer cell doors, locks, and hardware sets
per bed 
 Fewer toilet and sink fixtures per bed 
 Fewer interior walls 
 Less complicated electrical and mechanical
provisions, as well as fewer light fixtures 
 Savings on square footage, including dayroom
square footage 
A study done by Farbstein and Goldman, Housing
Pretrial Inmates: The Costs and Benefits
of Single Cells, Multiple Cells and Dormitories,
showed that the cost differential between single
and multiple occupancy is significantThe study

Association, )

found an overall facility construction cost savings
of – percent with various forms of multipleoccupancy
housing 
Operational Concerns
Although it is difficult to argue against saving
construction costs, jail administrators argue in
defense of single-occupancy cells for a variety of
reasonsSome jail officials concede that multiple
occupancy is acceptable for persons considered
low security, such as inmate workers or workrelease
inmates, even though it results in loss of
privacy and vulnerabilityHowever, they argue
that single occupancy is a must for inmates with
special behavioral, medical, or custody needs,
such as:
 Disciplinary detention 
 Medical isolation 
 High security 
 Protective custody 
 Serious mental health issues 
 Juveniles detained in adult facilities 
It is the general population between these
extremes for which local jurisdictions must
determine whether they want singleor multipleoccupancy
housingFollowing are the main arguments
against multiple occupancy for the general
population:
 It greatly reduces the staff’s ability to prevent
physical or sexual assaults, especially during
nighttime lockdown or other times when staffing
levels tend to be reducedThe exception
would be in direct supervision facilities where
staff have a continuous presence 
 It reduces the staff’s ability to control inmates
during disturbances because the staff cannot
fully separate the inmates and achieve a fully
secure lockdown until the emergency passes 
 It increases tensions because inmates have no
place to which to retreat to ensure personal
safety or personal space and no place in which
personal property can be completely protected
from theft or vandalism 
 It diminishes administrative control because
acts of vandalism in the multiple-occupancy
cell or dormitory cannot be clearly attributed
to one individual 
 It reduces flexibility, in that dramatic shifts
in the composition of the jail population may
force inmates who require single occupancy
into multiple-occupancy spaces 
 It causes inmates to completely forfeit personal
privacy because they may openly share
toilet
fixtures in close quarters and no other
area of the facility affords individual privacy 
Single-Occupancy Concerns
Two frequently cited operational concerns about
the use of single occupancy are suicide and
isolationThe isolation issue is easily resolved,
however, with the provision of an adjacent dayroom
serving a number of single-occupancy cells 
Such a dayroom provides ample opportunity for
contact between inmatesDayrooms are required
by the ACA standards and by many state jail
standards 
Suicide is a more difficult issueMany people feel
that single-occupancy cells are more conducive to
suicide attempts and that the presence of two or
more inmates in a multiple-occupancy setting
reduces the likelihood of suicideHowever, beyond
the question of whether inmates should be
relied on to prevent suicide by their cellmates,
the fact is that suicide has been a problem in
jails for years and most jails have, historically,
consisted mainly of multiple-occupancy cells or
dormitories 
 
C h a p t e r :
S i n g l e V e r s u s M u l t i p l e O c c u p a n c y
The primary way to control suicide is operational
rather than physical:
 Realizing that most attempts occur shortly
after
intake 
 Using suicide screening at intake to identify
suicide risks 
 Providing thorough staff training in recognizing
signs and symptoms of suicide risk 
 Providing adequate and frequent staff
observation
of suicidal inmates 
 Arranging for needed medical and/or mental
health services for troubled inmates 
 Increasing supervision and monitoring for
those for whom it is determined that self-destructive
behavior is likely 
Costs of Multiple Occupancy
On balance, it seems that certain security and
management capabilities are compromised
to attain the construction cost savings of
multiple-occupancy settingsOnce compromised,
these critical capabilities may be lost for the life
of the jail, which could exact a toll on the jail
staff and inmates 
Given the increased operational vulnerabilities
of multiple-occupancy housing (with the exception
of direct supervision facilities), jurisdictions
should evaluate whether initial construction cost
savings are merely expenses deferred until a
later datePotentially, these savings may at some
point be offset by higher medical bills due to
more frequent assaults, higher repair costs due
to increased
damage to jail property, or unanticipated
legal costs arising as inmates or their families
sue to recover damages as a consequence
of injuries received in the jailEach jurisdiction
must weigh the costs of staffing and other issues
before committing to multiple-occupancy cells 
Double-Occupancy Single Cells
One idea frequently considered during planning
is to build single-occupancy cells for later use as
double-occupancy cellsThis allows a community
to initially commit to single occupancy for
standards compliance or better operations, but to
accommodate expansion needs quickly and economically
at a later date by housing two people
in each cellA variety of problems are inherent to
this approach, however:
 Safety and security benefits of single
occupancy
will be lost 
 Compliance with state or accreditation
occupancy
standards must be maintained 
 Compliance with cell square footage requirements
may be lostFor example, if the singleoccupancy
cell provides the required square
footage for one inmate (per ACA and some
state standards), double celling reduces space
allocations to half of the minimum square
footage per inmate (exhibit )This same

 :
S p e c i a l C o n s i d e r a t i o n s
problem can occur with dayroom space
requirements 
For example, a dayroom space
adequate in square footage to accommodate
 inmates would now have to accommodate
up to 
 Designing for future double occupancy may
result in a waste of space and moneyReferring
to the example below, the architect would
have to create single-occupancy cells larger
in size to meet the minimum required square
footage per bed after double occupancyIf the
need to double cell fails to materialize, space
and money will have been wasted 
 Other features of the housing unit and jail will
have to be provided in excess (showers and
dayroom toilets) or over-designed (ventilation
systems, egress elements, plumbing lines) to
accommodate
possible future double occupancy 
This could also result in waste if the
double-occupancy option was never exercised 
 Certain classifications are not suitable for double
occupancy under any circumstances, thus
minimizing the capacity expansion benefits 
 The ratio of staff to inmates may become imbalanced
through later double occupancyFor
example, a -bed area adequately monitored
by a master control officer may become too
much to monitor ifinmates later occupy the
areaAn adequately supervised -bed directsupervision
housing unit may become too
much for one officer
as a -bed unit

Double and Single Cells Based on American Correctional
Association Performance-Based Standards for
Local Adult Detention Facilities

Detention Facilities, Fourth Edition (Alexandria, VA:
American Correctional Association, ) 
Generally, if sufficient reasons exist to initially
adopt a single-occupancy approach to the design
of a new jail, those reasons will not likely
diminish in the futureIf future growth in capacity
needs is the reason for creating a doubleoccupancy
option, providing an easy expansion
alternative would seem to be the best answer 
Conclusion
Financing a jail is difficult and costlyTherefore,
the need to create economical solutions is important 
However, each jurisdiction must carefully
weigh the pros and cons of singleversus
multiple-occupancy housingMultiple occupancy
may not be an effective way to achieve construction
cost savings if fundamental security, manageability,
operational efficiency, and standards
compliance are jeopardized by such an approach 
 
C h a p t e r
Renovating Nonsecure Buildings Into Jails
When confronted with the need for expensive
new jail facilities, county leaders
sometimes ask, “Is there an existing
facility that could be renovated for less?” This is
a natural question in the face of ever higher costs
for jail construction and ever increasing demands
for bed capacityIt seems especially logical when
communities have existing structures available
that are of an institutional character, such as
hospitals, schools, large retail space, and warehouses 
Some communities have even looked at
abandoned missile sites and grain silosRegardless
of the buildings available, renovation of an
existing structure is a possibility that demands
serious consideration 
The quest for renovation possibilities must include
an assessment of operational needsMany
existing buildings are eliminated as jail conversion
candidates because they do not meet local
jail operational requirements and, more specifically,
fail to accommodate effective inmate
classification, inmate supervision, and staffing
efficiencyIt is critical, therefore, for a community
to clearly establish the character of its future
jail operations before, not after, it begins a search
for renovation candidatesIt is not sufficient
to simply find a stout old building and assume
suitability
for renovation as a jail 
A Common Renovation Example
A hospital is an example of a building that seems
to be a natural prospect for renovation, but that
potential frequently breaks down under operational
analysisThe appeal of hospitals tends to
be that they are solidly built, have wings that
suggest separate housing areas, and have nursing
control stationsFurther, they have a series of
rooms with toilets and sinks on each wing,
which could be envisioned as jail cellsHospitals
usually have food preparation space and laundry
facilities, which can be appealing when looking
at renovation possibilities 
The hospital’s basic arrangement, however, can
become its greatest weaknessSpecifically, most
hospitals, including newer ones, are linear in
designThey consist of long, narrow wings with
rooms on either side of a wide corridor (in architectural
terms, a “double-loaded corridor”)The
hospital’s linear nature precludes the kinds of
views and control required for the direct supervision
or indirect surveillance of inmates (exhibit
)Additionally, hospitals are not designed
with sufficient common areas that can be used
for dayrooms, recreation, or visiting or program
space 
The hospital’s potential further diminishes if
inmates need to be housed in single-occupancy
cells, the minimum size of which is only onethird
to one-quarter as big as a normal hospital
roomPlacing lone inmates in rooms that are
to square feet in size is a clear waste of space
that also results in low inmate densities per wing
and per staff person 
Experience shows that hospitals and similar facilities
tend to work best as low-security operations
involving intermittently observed dormitory or
multiple-occupancy settingsAlthough the

renovation of an existing structure to be used
for low-security inmates can be accommodated
in larger systems, it is rare for the smaller jail to
have enough low-security inmates to justify the
acquisition and renovation of a hospital, school,
or other large industrial building 
Security Construction
A stout, old building does not necessarily have
acceptable security-grade construction and detailing
for use as a jailTherefore, a second hurdle
for a renovation candidate to pass is that of security
fitness 
Perimeter Issues
Security starts with the building perimeter, or
envelopeAs outlined in , “Security
Perimeter,” the security envelope is three dimensional,
including ceilings, roofs, floors, and walls 
Each of these elements, if not secure, must be
made secure to prevent escapes and contraband
passage 
The thick masonry walls commonly found in
older institutional or industrial facilities, which
create so much of their appeal, generally have
limited escape resistanceUnreinforced masonry,
no matter how thick, can be penetrated by
removing the mortar that binds the masonry
togetherMasonry walls in jails are generally
heavily reinforced and grouted to foil such efforts
(exhibit )Rectifying wall deficiencies in
nonsecure facilities can be very costly, involving
options as varied as ( ) applying a new barrier,
such as steel plate, over the walls, ( ) creating
fenced perimeters beyond the exterior walls, and
( ) creating entirely new perimeter walls within
the building

Windows in older institutional buildings tend to
be large in expanse, wood or aluminum framed,
and of nonsecurity glassNone of these characteristics
is conducive to keeping inmates confined 
Therefore, major security revisions must be
made while retaining the introduction of natural
light required by most jail standards and building
 
C h a p t e r :
R e n o v a t i n g N o n s e c u r e B u i l d i n g s I n t o J a i l s
codesWindow modification options include the
following:
 Reglazing the entire opening with detentiongrade
windows and lites (glass) 
 Filling substantial portions of the opening and
glazing the rest with a security-grade detention
window to reduce costs and opening size 
 Applying dense security-mesh screens over
the window opening 
The choice between these options may be influenced
by another issue, that of minimizing view
conflicts between inmates and the publicSuch
conflicts are a special concern at night when higher
indoor light levels enhance views into the jail 
Windows in older institutional facilities may be
operable to ensure adequate ventilationO perable
windows are generally not compatible with a
jail’s need to prevent escapes, communication
with the outside, and contraband passageTherefore,
windows must be sealed and mechanical
ventilation or air conditioning systems added or
enhanced, a potentially costly activity 
Interior Issues
Interior partitions (walls), doors, and locks of institutional
facilities tend to be inadequate for jail
security needs, thus requiring total replacement
and redesignLight fixtures, switches, outlets,
and lighting controls are rarely up to the security
and vandal-resistance requirements of a jail and
are inappropriately located for a jailThe same is
true of radiators, air diffusers, and thermostats 
Toilet and sink fixtures, as well as the water
lines, drains, and drain covers serving them,
are typically unsuited to the rigors of jail use 
These considerations regarding materials, hardware,
and equipment are essentially what distinguish
jail construction from the construction of
other institutional facilitiesMore importantly,
they define the ultimate safety and security of
the physical plant and its occupantsThese not-so-
obvious fine points are frequently missed
when a community is initially impressed with the
massiveness
of an existing institutional facility 
Costs
Many people assume that renovation is less
expensive
than new constructionThis explains
renovation’s principal appeal and exceeds other
virtues such as urban renewal and reuse of existing,
otherwise abandoned buildings of value 
However, substantial savings are frequently
unattainable when converting a building from
nonsecurity uses to secure jail usesFurther, the
cost saving issue is complicated by two other
considerations: long-term operational costs and
acquisition costs 
Construction Costs
If a building appears substantially constructed,
the assumption is that the cost of any internal
modifications is offset by the money saved by
avoiding exterior constructionHowever, when
the costs of a jail are broken down, it becomes
clear that only a fraction of the total cost of
building is spent on the outer shellExhibit 
shows a breakdown of jail costs by different components
of construction, as reported in RSMeans’
Square Foot Costs Working from that list, the
portions of the building listed in exhibit 
represent the shell, that is, the walls, roof, floor,
foundation, and key structural
elements involved
in their creation 
Square Foot Costs, th Annual Edition,(Kingston, MA: RSMeans Construction Publishers & Consultants, ) 
 
 :
S p e c i a l C o n s i d e r a t i o n s
Although the shell looks impressive and gives
the appearance of great value, it represents only
aboutpercent of the total construction cost of
a jailTherefore, about three-fourths of a jail’s
construction cost is in the interior elements 
Saving one-fourth of the cost of construction is
certainly attractive, but renovation entails additional
costsA major cost is potentially that of
upgrading the shell to security status, which may
involve reinforcing walls, building walls within
the walls, adding security windows (sometimes
by cutting openings through solid walls), and
securing the ceiling/roof assembliesIf the particular
building being examined has walls, doors,
ceilings, and floor finishes that must be removed
to make way for the jail design, a demolition cost
is added to the cost projection

Reconfiguring the floor plan to meet jail needs

can also require altering the location of supply
and return air ducts and openingsRedoing
plumbing systems and penetrating existing flooring
for new water supply and drain lines can
be very costlyNonsecurity suspended ceilings,
such as lay-in ceiling tiles and drywall ceilings,
may need complete replacementNew concrete
block cell walls can add excessive load to the
floor, thus requiring additional structural support 
Depending on the building, making all of these
changes can be a very expensive proposition 
These sorts of cost factors can quickly erode the
money saved on the shell, thus leading to costs
comparable to those of new construction 
Even if conversion is feasible and renovation
would save – percent of the cost of new construction,
the jurisdiction is once again advised

to consider operational issues before committing
to the renovation projectGiven that a building
designed for a different function is being
converted, the renovation layout is frequently
not as effective
or efficient as a new design and
may have inevitable, unacceptable functional
compromises 
Other planning concerns, such as
the need for expansion, sufficient parking, and
public access,
may also be compromised 
Operational Costs
Operational costs, particularly those of staffing,
are actually the biggest part of a jail’s economics 
Over the long run, the costs of staffing
and operating a jail will far exceed the costs of
construction
and project financingIf the price
of cheaper construction is the addition of one or
two more -hour-a-day,-day-a-week posts, the
economic impact on a jail can be devastating 
The cost analysis in exhibit -demonstrates
the differences over a -year life cycle between
a new-bed jail and a renovated facility of
equal capacityThe essential differences are that
renovation costs are assumed to bepercent
less than new construction and the staffing for
the renovated facility is greater by one officer per
shiftAn average interest rate of percent and an
inflation rate of percent are used 
Acquisition Costs
A key factor in assessing project costs is the acquisition
cost of the site and building being considered
for renovationThe purchase price of the
facility could be greater than any potential savings
over new constructionAlso, if private property
is purchased, the cost calculation must take
into account tax receipts that will be lost once
the property is removed from the tax rolls 
Conclusion
Local officials should by all means examine
renovation options before committing to new
constructionConstruction cost savings may be
there to find within the context of creating secure
facilities that meet local needs 
However, experience shows that many renovation
options either fail to offer the savings initially expected
or offer measurable savings at the cost of
functionality, safety, or staff efficiencyBefore a
jurisdiction enters into public or private commitments,
it should temper its enthusiasm for
renovation options with a reasoned analysis
of a building’s ability to meet preestablished
goals for inmate classification, surveillance/
supervision, safety/security, staffing efficiency,
and true convertibility

Construction and Project Costs
Although jail construction costs are significant,
they do not represent the total perbed
cost paid by a jurisdiction to complete
its projectAdditional costs significantly increase
the expense of the jailWhen these costs are
added
to construction costs, one arrives at the
actual project cost 
The project cost represents the true cost of building
a jail and is not clearly understood by many
jurisdictionsFailing to understand the difference
between the project cost and construction costs
has caused jurisdictions to plan inadequately for
project funding or for referendums requesting
fundingThis, in turn, has led to underfinanced
projects that provide less capacity than required,
less support and program space than needed,
and/or a building with less quality and durability
than desiredIt has also led to embarrassment
when the public has seen that their local officials
did not understand the costs involved in the jail
projectThisclarifies the differences between
construction and project costs 
Construction Costs
Construction costs are those costs that relate
specifically
and exclusively to the construction of
the buildingThey typically include costs for:
 Site preparation 
 All materials required for construction 
 All labor required to assemble the building
materials 
 All overhead and profit of the contractor(s) 
 All equipment and furnishings that are physically
attached (fixed) to the building 
 Basic site improvements, such as landscaping
and on-grade parking and sidewalks associated
with the building

Project Cost
Even though construction costs represent the
major
part of a jail’s cost, many other costs
must be incurred to actually build the jailThese
“other costs,” when combined with construction
costs, give the total project cost 
The other costs involved in producing a project
can be quite significantAs a rule of thumb, it
is wise to plan initially on adding – percent
to the construction costs of the building (exhibit
-
 )That is, if the jail is expected to cost $
million to construct, it would be wise initially
to add another $ –$million to estimate the
true project costA $ million construction cost
could easily result in a $ million project cost

The ratio of project cost to construction costs will
vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction
because many variables are involvedIt is critical,
however, for a jurisdiction to conduct all
of its financial planning, even from the earliest
phases of the effort, with an appreciation of all
costs involved with the project 
Project Cost Factors
The most significant and typical cost factors that
add to basic construction costs to create a project
cost follow 
 Site acquisitionThis covers the cost of any
land and buildings needed to create the jail
site 
 DemolitionIf the acquired site has existing
buildings or features such as pavement
or
retaining walls, the cost of demolishing these
structures and disposing of the waste in preparation
for future construction must be taken
into account 
 UtilitiesCosts are associated with providing
utilities to a site (particularly a remote site)
or relocating existing utilities (e g , gas lines,
power lines) that would otherwise interfere
with construction 
 Professional feesThese are the fees for the
architects and engineers who will design the
building and develop all of the structural,
mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering
systems for the building and the siteFees will
vary depending on the size and complexity of
the building and whether it is new construction,
renovation, and/or an additionProfessional
fees also include those for specialists
such as food service consultants, interior
designers, and construction managersMany
jurisdictions will retain the services of a jail
planner early in the facility development process
to conduct a needs assessment and feasibility
study prior to engaging a design firm(s) 
 ReimbursablesVarious expenses are incurred
by professionals during the course of the project
and are generally billed back to the owner
as a reimbursable expenseTypical reimbursables
for an architect, for example, include the
costs of travel, report printing, courier services,
and construction document reproduction 
 Furnishings and equipmentAll of the desks,
chairs, file cabinets, copy machines, computers,
kitchen and laundry equipment, inmate furniture,
and other unfixed items that must be purchased
for the operation of a building incur additional
expensesAlso included in this cost might be
such things as potted plants, window coverings,
and other unattached office decorations 
 Site surveyBefore design can begin, a complete
survey of the site must be completed 
This survey will establish the location of all
buildings, the contours of the site, the location
of all utilities, and any easements and
setbacks 
 Special testingA variety of special tests not
typically included in the construction contract
will be made before and during construction,
such as tests of the soil conditions and selected
materials 
 Legal feesA variety of legal fees might be
paid during the project, for example, fees for
condemning and acquiring propertiesLegal
fees may be incurred in developing clear title
to land, requesting variances, obtaining zoning
changes, settling disputes, and negotiating
contracts 
 Project managerSome jurisdictions think it
is wise to hire their own project managerThis
representative serves as a liaison between
the
county, the architect, and the contractorsThe
project manager helps ensure that the project
is proceeding in accordance with contractual
obligations required by the countySuch
a person
may also keep a record of design
 
C h a p t e r :
C o n s t r u c t i o n a n d P r o j e c t C o s t s
and construction progress for the county as
insurance
against failures to meet contract
demands 
 Selling bondsIf bonds must be sold to
finance
a project, a fee is generally paid to
the firm or individual arranging for the sale 
 TransitionTo prepare for the transition into
the new jail, jurisdictions are well advised to
add funding for a transition team made up of
existing staff members and, perhaps, a consultant,
to focus on the significant amount
of work to be done before opening the new
building: writing policy, procedures, and staff
post orders; establishing a hiring and training
schedule; and so forthMore on this important
subject can be found in 
 MovingProfessional movers are sometimes
retained to move furniture and equipment
from the old building to the new 
 Telephone and radio communications equipment 
Telephone and radio communications
equipment is frequently purchased from a
vendor
or provider outside of the normal
construction contractFor law enforcement
portions of a jail, the cost of the E-radio
equipment and computer-aided dispatch systems
are generally outside the construction
budget 
Example
Exhibit -shows an example of a hypothetical
project budget based on a $ million construction
cost and the typical cost factors outlined
aboveIn this example, the cost factors other
than construction costs are equal to about 
percent of the cost of construction and represent
 percent of the total project costThese costs
can vary considerably from project to project and
may include other factorsThis example is provided
only to enhance the reader’s understanding
of the magnitude of the project cost 
Conclusion
In planning the financial aspects of a proposed
project, it is important to understand all
operational
and construction-related costs to be
incurredOnly then can a jurisdiction make informed
decisions about the size and nature of the
project to be developed and adequately prepare
for the expenses to come and the revenues needed
to cover them

Making a Building Work
A common mistake made by many local government
officials is to think that their role
in the development of a new jail ends with
the completion of the architectural phase of the
project 
Others mistakenly feel that their role is ended
before construction documents are complete
because construction demands are such that the
client frequently feels there is little he or she
can contribute or has been convinced that the
architect or contractor will simply turn over the
keys when the building is completeThe jurisdiction
must remember that a jail facility’s security
and overall success depend largely on staff and
managementIn fact, attention to operational and
transitional issues at this point will yield major
benefits laterFailure to plan for the opening of a
new facility has led to a number of embarrassing
problems:
 Delays in the opening of new facilities when it
was discovered that the recruitment, selection,
training, and funding of new staff had been
overlooked 
 Multiple system failures in the newly occupied
jail due to lack of testing of equipment prior to
moving the inmates into the new facility 
 Discovery upon opening that the staff were
not sufficiently trained in the operation of the
more complex equipment and systems found
in their modern, high-technology facilityIn
one instance, inmates were able to simply
walk out the front door of a new jail because
staff did not fully understand the door status
indicator system 
 Considerable damage to new facilities because
they were seriously understaffed or staff were
improperly trained—or not trained—in managing
the inmate populationThis can be a
serious problem in direct supervision facilities
when staff members are not adequately trained
in inmate management 
 Failure to implement the inmate classification
system or planned services and programs
intended to alleviate boredom and manage
behavior because these things simply were not
given priority in the transition processAs one
sheriff put it, “Once you open the door, all hell
breaks loose ”
 Rapid overcrowding for reasons other than
being built too smallFor example, the size
of numerous new jails has been based on
assumptions
about continuation or implementation
of population-reducing alternatives to
incarceration that either were not implemented
after the new jail opened or were subsequently
discontinued 
 Considerable disruption, unrest, and verbal
and physical confrontations among inmates in
the housing units of newly opened facilities
because staff had little knowledge of a classification
system that was intended to separate
the violent from the nonviolent and the “prey”
from the “predators ”
These are all examples of facilities that did not
“work” wellThey were not all necessarily facilities
that were poorly planned, designed, or constructed 
Rather, they were facilities where there
was inadequate preparation for opening or where
key planning assumptions were never implemented
or staffing and budget commitments fell short

Construction Monitoring
The transition team is often tasked with monitoring
the construction process, not only to become
familiar with the new building, but to watch for
problems in the processBecause the transition
team is made up of facility staff, it can prove to
be a significant resource in identifying potential
problems, such as gaps or improperly installed
fixtures that result in hiding places for contraband;
equipment, fixtures, or construction
that do not meet specifications; and shoddy
workmanship 
Policy and Procedure Development
A comprehensive set of written operational
policies
and procedures is vital to operating a jail
that avoids incurring unnecessary liability risks 
Well-researched and drafted policies and procedures
tailored to a particular facility serve the
jail administration in many waysPrimarily, they
provide an essential training tool that ensures
consistency of performance among all jail officers
and other staff, provides guidance for staff when

administrative personnel are not immediately
on the scene in an emergency, and provides
protection for the county against liability when
individual acts can be shown to be outside of the
prescribed practices dictated by the policy and
procedures manual 
No facility, particularly no new one, should operate
without a well-researched and knowledgeably
prepared set of written policies and procedures
that are developed specifically for the facility and
are compliant with current case law, professional
practices, local statutes, and state and professional
standardsThe policy and procedure development
process requires heavy involvement by
local jail staffThe process of preparing a policy
and procedures manual includes the following
tasks:
 Outline the issues and topics to be covered 
 Review previous manuals or manuals from
other facilities for relevancy and new ideas
(
errors, omissions, deletions, or additions) 
 Research and document applicable case law,
state statutes and standards, and recommended
professional standards 
 Hold discussions during which key policy
decisions
are made 
 Tailor all policies and procedures to the
specific
design solution proposed and the
inmate
management plan 
 Draft specific scenarios for all of the procedures
to be implemented in the new facility 
 Draft the initial policy and procedures manual 
 “Field test” the draft policies and procedures
by walking through them on facility models
or
plans or in the facility itself 
 Review, comment, and modify until the final
document is complete 
 Train all staff 
 Develop a way to make modifications to
procedures
once training has been completed
and the facility occupied 
Final Staffing Plan and Staff Post
Orders
A final staffing plan for the new facility that is
consistent with the final facility design and the
revised policies and procedures must be prepared 
This includes documenting staff needs by
function, number, and shift, including consideration
of the impact of weekends, holidays, sick
leave, training leave, absenteeism, and other such
factors that affect the need for post coverage
Post orders detailing precise responsibilities and
tasks for each post and position indicated in the
final jail staffing plan and the written policies
and procedures must be prepared and implemented
in the same manner as operational policies
and proceduresWhereas the policies and
procedures provide staff direction for what is to
be done, why it is to be done, and how it will
be done, post orders detail which tasks are to
be done, when they are to be done, and who
will do them 
Staff Recruitment and Selection
Staff recruitment and selection have evolved from
a very simple process to one that often involves
the administration of a variety of psychological
screening and aptitude measurement instruments
and oral interviewsHaphazard recruitment and

Justice, National Institute of Corrections, ), www nicic gov/Library/, accessed February ,
 
 :
S p e c i a l C o n s i d e r a t i o n s
selection can seriously jeopardize the operation
of a new jail and expose the local government to
tremendous liabilityJurisdictions should execute
this process according to a plan consistent with
formal personnel practices and state/federal laws
governing employment 
Too many jurisdictions do not devote sufficient
time to recruitment and selectionNew staff
should be hired well in advance of the facility’s
scheduled opening so that they can participate
in mandatory state (academy) training programs
and local training specific to the new facility 
Staff Training
New and current officers need training in the
operation and philosophy of the new jailSuch
training should focus on current case law, techniques
of managing inmates, and, most importantly,
on the application of the new policies and
procedures that have been written and must now
be implemented 
Training jail officers in policies and procedures for
advanced inmate supervision and management
techniques and for the operation of the new electronic
equipment and hardware in the jail is critical 
Such training should be in addition to any
mandatory basic training required by the state 
The training should also emphasize practical
exercises, such as conducting emergency facility
evacuation drills and responding to “officer
down” situations 
Testing should be administered to ensure adequate
understanding and performance of just
how the new facility equipment and physical
plant are intended to operate and to identify
areas where staff have particular questions or
problems

Move Logistics
Each jurisdiction must prepare a detailed plan for
making the actual move to the new jail and the
sequencing steps involvedMove logistics include
considerations such as the following:
 The means of transporting inmates to the
new facility 
 When to begin moving inmates and
equipment 
 How to move inmates and equipment in such
a way that both staff and inmates can move
gradually and smoothly while closing down
the old jail 
 Arrangements for enhanced security during
transport 
 Plans for staffing two or more facilities during
the inmate transfer 
 Numerous other related matters 
The following tasks must be considered when
developing a move logistics plan:
 Preparing and delivering training programs for
new staff, existing staff, supervisory staff, and
so forth 
 Scheduling and conducting public tours 
 Assisting in interviewing potential staff 
 Testing equipment and observing its installation
for training of staff on its operation 
 Preparing the overall Transition Master Plan
and schedules 
 Orienting other law enforcement agencies,
vendors, and other facility users for interaction
at the new facility 
 Finalizing and directing the actual move 
 Preparing orientation material for inmates who
will be transferred to the new facility 
 Conducting facility shakedowns and “walking
through” all operational scenarios 
 Coordinating with maintenance staff on the
operation of mechanical and electrical systems 
 Developing emergency plans for inmate
evacuations
that include inmate retention,
emergency staff provisions, and fire drills for
new staff 
 Documenting that all new furniture, equipment,
and forms have been ordered and
installed 
New facility mechanical and electrical systems
are typically far more complex than those found
in other existing county buildings and the old
jailIt is of critical importance that existing or
additional county maintenance personnel who
will be assigned to the new facility have an
opportunity
to monitor the onsite installation of
mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systemsIt
is also important to involve local facility maintenance
staff in all postdesign activities involved in
the construction phase 
Summary
Making the new building work will require team
work, good communication, a cooperative spirit,
and full commitment from all those who were
involved in preactivation (planners, designers,
contractors, and transition staff) as well as those
involved in the activation and operation of the
facility (the funding authority, management and
line staff, support staff, maintenance personnel,
volunteers, and the community) if the facility
is to realize its full potential and serve the community
as intended.
